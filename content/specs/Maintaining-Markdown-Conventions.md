Rendered components should automagically hide Dataview Syntax. Dataview Syntax originates from the popular Dataview plugin for Obsidian. 

This syntax declares a key::value pair that can be used in code. 

For instance:
`session-close::'2025-03-19T04:51:05.362Z'`
is intended to give the ability for the Markdown rendering to display the time the author finished writing that particular draft.

There may be more use cases to come.
