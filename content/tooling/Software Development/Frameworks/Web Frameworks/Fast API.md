> [!NOTE]
> "The key features are:
> - Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
> - Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
> - Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
> - Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
> - Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
> - Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
> - Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
> - Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema."
