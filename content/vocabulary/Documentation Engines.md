### [[Perplexity AI]] explains Documentation Engines
Documentation frameworks are sometimes referred to as "documentation engines" because they often automate or streamline the process of generating, managing, and maintaining documentation. Here are key distinctions:

- **Automation**: Documentation engines like Doxygen or Javadoc extract information directly from source code (e.g., comments) to auto-generate documentation, reducing manual effort[2][3].
- **Specialization**: Engines are more specialized tools designed for specific tasks, such as creating developer-focused technical documents, whereas frameworks are broader and more abstract systems that provide reusable structures[6].
- **Functionality**: Engines often include features like syntax highlighting, diagram generation, and cross-referencing, making them powerful tools for producing consistent and professional documentation[3].

In essence, "engine" emphasizes the tool's automated and specialized capabilities.
