[[Perplexity AI]] explains [[Natural Language Processing]]
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in text or speech form. It combines computational linguistics, rule-based modeling, and machine learning to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding. Applications include chatbots, translation tools, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants like Siri or Alexa[1][5][9].

### Breakthroughs in NLP
1. **Transition to Deep Learning**: Early NLP relied on rule-based systems and statistical models. The advent of deep learning and neural networks like RNNs and LSTMs improved language modeling by capturing sequential data patterns[4][9].
2. **Transformer Models**: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 revolutionized NLP. Models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) set new benchmarks in tasks like text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis[3][4].
3. **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-training on massive datasets followed by fine-tuning for specific tasks allowed models to generalize better across domains[7].
4. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: LLMs like GPT-3/4 leverage vast datasets and billions of parameters, achieving near-human performance in language understanding and generation[2][12].

### NLP as a Precursor to LLMs
NLP laid the foundation for LLMs by developing techniques to process language at scale. Early statistical models evolved into deep learning approaches, culminating in transformer-based architectures that power LLMs today. LLMs scale up NLP by training on massive datasets with advanced algorithms, enabling nuanced understanding of context and semantics. This evolution has transformed NLP from task-specific systems to versatile models capable of handling diverse applications[2][4][10].
