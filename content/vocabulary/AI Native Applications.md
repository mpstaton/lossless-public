> [!NOTE] AI Explains
> ### **What is an AI Native Application?**
> 
> An **AI Native Application** is a software application designed and built from the ground up to leverage **artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities** as a core part of its functionality, architecture, and user experience. Unlike traditional applications that may integrate AI as an add-on or secondary feature, AI native applications are fundamentally driven by AI technologies. They rely on AI to deliver their primary value proposition and often evolve dynamically as they learn from data or user interactions.
> 
> These applications are not just “AI-enhanced”; they are **AI-first**, where AI is central to their design, purpose, and operation.
