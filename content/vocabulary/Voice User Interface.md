[[Perplexity AI]] explains a [[Voice User Interface]]
A **Voice User Interface (VUI)** allows users to interact with devices or applications through spoken commands, using technologies like speech recognition and natural language processing to understand and respond to voice inputs[1][7].

### Applications Beyond Alexa and HomePod
While smart speakers like Alexa and HomePod are popular examples, VUIs are used in various other ways:

- **Automotive Systems**: VUIs enable hands-free control of navigation, entertainment, and climate settings in cars, improving safety and convenience[8][10].
- **Wearables**: Devices like smartwatches use VUIs for tasks such as setting reminders, tracking fitness, or sending messages via voice commands[2][4].
- **Customer Service**: Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems handle customer queries, route calls, or provide automated assistance in call centers[5][10].
- **Healthcare**: VUIs assist in managing patient data, accessing medical records, or monitoring patients remotely[8].
- **Retail and Banking**: Voice biometrics authenticate users for secure transactions, while virtual assistants enhance shopping experiences with personalized recommendations[5][8].
- **Home Automation**: VUIs control smart home devices like lights, thermostats, and appliances through voice commands[8][10].

These applications demonstrate the versatility of VUIs across industries, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.
