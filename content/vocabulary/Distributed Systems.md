> ### **Distributed Systems in Computer Science**
> 
> A **Distributed System** is a collection of independent computers that work together as a unified system to achieve a common goal. These systems are interconnected via a network and communicate through message passing to coordinate their actions. Despite being physically separated, they appear to users as a single cohesive system.

> ### **Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems**
> 
> 1. **Decentralization**:
>     - No single computer has complete control; components work together to perform tasks.
> 2. **Concurrency**:
>     - Multiple processes run simultaneously across different nodes, enabling parallel processing.
> 3. **Fault Tolerance**:
>     - The system can continue functioning even if some components fail, through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
> 4. **Scalability**:
>     - Distributed systems can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to handle increased workloads.
> 5. **Transparency**:
>     - Users perceive the system as a single entity, hiding the complexities of distributed operations (e.g., data location, failures).

> ### **Components of Distributed Systems**
> 
> 6. **Nodes**:
>     - Independent machines (servers, computers, IoT devices) that function as components of the system.
> 7. **Network**:
>     - The communication medium (e.g., LAN, WAN, the internet) that allows these nodes to exchange information.
> 8. **Middleware**:
>     - Software that facilitates communication and resource sharing between nodes, ensuring interoperability and consistency.
> 9. **Data and State Management**:
>     - Mechanisms to store, replicate, and synchronize data across nodes.

> ### **How Distributed Systems Work**
> 
> Distributed systems rely on **coordination** and **communication** between nodes, typically achieved through:
> 
> 10. **Message Passing**:
>     - Nodes communicate by sending and receiving messages (e.g., HTTP requests, RPCs).
> 11. **Consensus Algorithms**:
>     - Algorithms like **Paxos** or **Raft** are used to ensure that nodes agree on the state of the system, even in the presence of failures.
> 12. **Replication**:
>     - Data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure availability and fault tolerance.
> 13. **[[Load Balancing]]**:
>     - Workloads are distributed evenly across nodes to optimize performance and resource utilization.
> 14. **Eventual Consistency**:
>     - Distributed systems often aim for eventual consistency, where all nodes converge to the same state over time.

>"Leslie Lamport revolutionized how computers talk to each other. The Turing Award-winning computer scientist pioneered the field of distributed systems, where multiple components on different networks coordinate to achieve a common objective. (Internet searches, cloud computing and artificial intelligence all involve orchestrating legions of powerful computing machines to work together.) In the early 1980s, Lamport also created LaTeX, a document preparation system that provides sophisticated ways to typeset complex formulas and format scientific documents. In 1989, Lamport invented Paxos, a “consensus algorithm” that allows multiple computers to execute complex tasks; without it, modern computing could not exist. He’s also brought more attention to a handful of problems, giving them distinctive names like the bakery algorithm and the Byzantine Generals Problem. Lamport’s work since the 1990s has focused on “formal verification,” the use of mathematical proofs to verify the correctness of software and hardware systems. Notably, he created a “specification language” called TLA+ (for Temporal Logic of Actions), which employs the precise language of mathematics to prevent bugs and avoid design flaws."
