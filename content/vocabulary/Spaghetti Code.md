[[Perplexity AI]] explains [[Spaghetti Code]]
**Spaghetti code** refers to unstructured, tangled, and difficult-to-maintain source code. Its name comes from its resemblance to a plate of spaghetti, with logic and flow twisted and interwoven in a confusing manner. It often arises due to poor planning, lack of experience, tight deadlines, or frequent quick fixes during development[1][3][7].

### Effects on Developer Experience and Productivity:
1. **Decreased Productivity**: Developers spend excessive time understanding the code rather than adding features or fixing bugs[7][9].
2. **Increased Maintenance Costs**: Debugging and updating spaghetti code is time-consuming and error-prone[3][7].
3. **Higher Risk of Bugs**: Complex interdependencies make changes risky, often introducing new issues[7][9].
4. **Poor Collaboration**: The lack of clarity makes it hard for teams to work together, especially for new developers joining the project[9].
5. **Scalability Challenges**: Expanding or modifying such codebases becomes increasingly difficult over time[9].

Overall, spaghetti code hampers developer morale and slows down project progress, making clean and modular coding practices essential for long-term success.

The main causes of spaghetti code include:

1. **Lack of Proper Planning**: Jumping into coding without designing or structuring the architecture leads to disorganized code as the project grows[2][3][4].

2. **Inexperienced Developers**: Developers with limited experience may use inefficient practices, such as overusing global variables, GOTO commands, or copy-pasting code without understanding it[3][5][6].

3. **Volatile Requirements**: Frequently changing project requirements can result in rushed modifications, creating tangled and unstructured logic[6][7].

4. **Poor Coding Practices**: Failure to follow coding standards, lack of comments, and improper use of control structures contribute to chaotic codebases[2][3].

5. **Rapid Development and Deadlines**: When developers prioritize speed over quality to meet deadlines, they often skip refactoring and introduce quick fixes that degrade code structure over time[3][4].

6. **Lack of Collaboration and Consistency**: Multiple developers working without consistent coding styles can disrupt the overall structure of a codebase[5].

7. **Insufficient Documentation and Design Rules**: Missing guidelines for software architecture and inter-component interfaces can lead to poorly organized systems[1]. 

These factors collectively make the code harder to maintain, scale, and debug.
