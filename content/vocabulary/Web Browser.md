A **web browser** is software that allows users to access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web. It works by fetching resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) from web servers, interpreting the code, and rendering it into user-friendly web pages. Browsers also manage navigation, security, and interactivity through components like rendering engines (e.g., Blink, Gecko) and JavaScript engines[1][5][9].

### How Web Browsers Work:
1. **Fetching Resources**: The browser sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to web servers to retrieve files.
2. **Parsing**: HTML is parsed into a DOM tree, CSS styles are applied, and JavaScript is executed.
3. **Rendering**: The browser combines these elements into a render tree to display the web page visually[1][2][9].

### Uncommon Web Browsers:
- **Stainless**: Allows logging into one site with multiple accounts in separate tabs[3].
- **Maxthon**: Highly customizable with built-in ad blocking and security features[3].
- **Falkon**: Lightweight and fast with robust privacy features[7].
- **Lunascape**: Supports multiple rendering engines for flexibility[3].
- **SeaMonkey**: An all-in-one internet suite with email and chat integration[3].
- **Konqueror**: A file manager and browser for Linux systems[3].
- **Yandex Browser**: Focuses on security with built-in antivirus tools[7].

Colibri's interface stands out from other browsers due to its **minimalistic and tabless design**, which eliminates traditional elements like tabs, bookmarks, and a visible address bar. Instead, it uses features such as:

- **Links Panel**: A manager for saving and organizing favorite URLs, replacing traditional bookmarks.
- **Pinboards**: A blend of bookmarks and note-taking for organizing content visually.
- **Distraction-Free Browsing**: The compact interface maximizes screen space for content by removing clutter like a tab bar, offering a streamlined experience[1][2][3].

This design focuses on simplicity and productivity but may not suit users who rely on multitasking with multiple open tabs.
