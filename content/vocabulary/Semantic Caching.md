[[Perplexity AI]] explains [[Semantic Caching]]
Semantic caching is an advanced data retrieval mechanism that focuses on the *meaning* and *intent* of queries rather than exact matches. It breaks queries into reusable, context-driven fragments, allowing systems to identify semantically similar requests and reuse cached responses. This reduces latency, improves system scalability, and lowers computational costs compared to traditional caching methods[1][4][5].

### **How Semantic Caching Works**
1. **Query Analysis**: Incoming queries are analyzed for their semantic meaning using techniques like natural language processing (NLP) or embedding models.
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Queries are converted into vector embeddings that capture their meaning and context.
3. **Cache Storage**: The cache stores both the query results and their semantic metadata (e.g., intent, constraints).
4. **Similarity Search**: When a new query arrives, the system performs a similarity search in the cache to find semantically related entries.
5. **Response Delivery**: If a match is found, the cached response is served; otherwise, the system processes the query and updates the cache dynamically[2][5][12].

### **Technologies Using Semantic Caching**
- **[[Generative AI]] Applications**: Large language models ([[Large Language Models|LLMs]]) like chatbots and [[Natural Language Processing]] systems use semantic caching to optimize responses[2][11].
- **Search Engines**: Semantic search engines leverage it to improve query relevance[1][12].
- **Real-Time [[Application Programming Interface|APIs]]**: Applications requiring fast and scalable data retrieval[4].
- **Customer Support Systems**: For handling varied but semantically similar queries[8].

### **Technologies Providing Semantic Caching**
- **Amazon MemoryDB**: Offers persistent semantic caching for generative AI workloads[10].
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Implements vector-based semantic caching for LLMs[2].
- **Fastly AI Accelerator**: Provides semantic caching for LLM APIs to enhance performance and reduce costs[3].
- **[[Redis]]**: Integrates semantic caching with AI embedding models for faster retrieval[13].
- **[[Kong]] AI Semantic Cache Plugin**: Adds semantic caching capabilities to APIs[7].

Semantic caching is increasingly vital for modern AI systems, enabling faster, smarter, and more cost-efficient data handling in dynamic environments.
