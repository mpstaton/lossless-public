Here is how [[Generative AI]], [[Poe AI]] describes an [[Remote Procedure Call|RPC]].

> [!NOTE]
>A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is like a magical phone call made by one computer to another, allowing it to ask for help without needing to understand how the other computer works internally. Imagine you're in a large library, and you want a specific book. Instead of searching through the shelves yourself, you simply tell a librarian (the other computer) what book you need. The librarian knows how to find it and brings it back to you.

>In technical terms, when a program on one machine wants to execute a function that resides on another machine, it sends a request over the network. This request includes the details of the function and any necessary data. The remote machine receives the request, performs the function, and sends back the results. This communication is often seamless, making it feel like the function is being called locally, even though it happens across different systems.

>RPCs help in building [[Distributed Systems]], allowing different applications to work together efficiently, as if they were part of the same program.
