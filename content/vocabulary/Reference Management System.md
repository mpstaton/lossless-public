> ### **What are Reference Management Systems?**
> 
> A **Reference Management System (RMS)**, also known as citation management software, is a tool used by researchers, academics, and students to organize, store, and cite references for research papers, articles, or projects. These systems help users collect bibliographic data—such as titles, authors, publication dates, and journal names—and generate citations and bibliographies in various formats (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
> 
> Modern RMS tools often integrate with word processors, web browsers, and academic databases, simplifying the process of sourcing, managing, and citing references.
