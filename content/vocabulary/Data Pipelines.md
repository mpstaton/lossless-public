> [!NOTE] AI Explains [[Data Pipelines]]
> A **data pipeline** is a series of processes that automate the movement, transformation, and storage of data from one system to another. It enables the seamless flow of data between sources (e.g., databases, APIs, IoT devices) and destinations (e.g., data warehouses, analytics tools, machine learning models). A pipeline typically involves steps like data extraction, transformation, validation, enrichment, and loading.
> 
> Data pipelines are essential for organizations that need to handle large volumes of data efficiently, enabling real-time analytics, data-driven decision-making, and machine learning workflows.
