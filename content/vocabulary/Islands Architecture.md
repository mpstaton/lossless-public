Balances paradigms of [[Web Development]] that pursue fast, navigable sites with many public facing pages (such as [[Static Site Generators|Static Site Generation]], [[Server Side Rendering]]) with interactive behavior customized to the user (such as [[Client-Side Rendered|Client-Side Rendering]]).

>"The term Islands architecture was popularized by Katie Sylor-Miller and Jason Miller to describe a paradigm that aims to reduce the volume of JavaScript shipped through “islands” of interactivity that can be independent delivered on top of otherwise static HTML. Islands are a component-based architecture that suggests a compartmentalized view of the page with static and dynamic islands. The static regions of the page are pure non-interactive HTML and do not need hydration. The dynamic regions are a combination of HTML and scripts capable of rehydrating themselves after rendering."
