Web scrapers are tools or programs designed to extract data from websites automatically. They work by performing the following steps:

1. **Sending an HTTP Request**: The scraper requests access to a website's server, similar to how a browser loads a webpage[1][3].
2. **Parsing Website Code**: Once access is granted, the scraper analyzes the HTML or other code to identify and extract specific data, such as text, images, or prices[2][3].
3. **Exporting Data**: The extracted information is then saved in a structured format like a spreadsheet or database for further use[2][4].

Web scraping is widely used for purposes like market research, price monitoring, sentiment analysis, and SEO audits. However, it can raise ethical and legal concerns depending on the type of data being collected and how it is used[1][3].
