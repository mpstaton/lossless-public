> ### **Holacracy: A Management Concept**
> 
> Holacracy is a decentralized management structure designed to distribute authority and decision-making across an organization. The concept moves away from traditional hierarchical leadership models, instead empowering teams and individuals to manage their own roles and responsibilities within a structured framework. Developed by Brian Robertson in the early 2000s, Holacracy is defined by its emphasis on self-organization and adaptability.

> ### **Key Features of Holacracy**
> 
> 1. **Role-Based Structure**:
>     
>     - Instead of job titles, employees hold specific "roles" that define their responsibilities.
>     - Roles are dynamic and can evolve as organizational needs change.
> 2. **Decision-Making Authority**:
>     
>     - Decision-making is distributed to individuals or teams, reducing the need for hierarchical approval.
>     - Each role-holder has autonomy within their defined responsibilities.
> 3. **Governance Process**:
>     
>     - Regular governance meetings allow teams to update roles, policies, and processes to meet changing needs.
>     - Decisions are based on structured discussions rather than managerial directives.
> 4. **Tactical Meetings**:
>     
>     - Teams hold frequent tactical meetings to discuss operational issues and assign work.
>     - These meetings focus on problem-solving and aligning goals.
> 5. **Circle Structure**:
>     
>     - The organization is divided into "circles," which are semi-autonomous groups of roles focused on specific functions.
>     - Circles can have sub-circles, creating a nested structure that replaces traditional hierarchies.
> 6. **Transparent Rules**:
>     
>     - Holacracy operates under a constitution that outlines roles, responsibilities, and processes.
>     - This standardization ensures clarity and consistency.
