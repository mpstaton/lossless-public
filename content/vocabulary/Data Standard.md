> ## What are Data Standards?
> Data standards are predefined rules or guidelines that govern how data is structured, formatted, stored, and exchanged to ensure consistency, interoperability, and usability across systems[1][2][4]. They are essential for improving data quality, enabling seamless communication between systems, and supporting decision-making processes[2][5].
> 
> ### **Why Are Data Standards Created?**
> Organizations create data standards to:
> - Ensure **interoperability** between systems and platforms[4][11].
> - Facilitate **data sharing** and reuse across industries[6].
> - Maintain **data quality** and consistency for analytics and compliance with regulations like [[(GDPR) General Data Protection Regulation]] or HIPAA[9].
> - Reduce inefficiencies in data integration and processing[2].
> 
> ### **How Are Data Standards Maintained?**
> Standards organizations like [[ISO]], ANSI, or industry-specific groups develop and oversee data standards. Maintenance involves:
> - Regular updates to address technological advancements.
> - Collaboration among stakeholders to ensure relevance and usability.
> - Governance policies to enforce adherence and manage revisions[10][11].
> 
> ### **Important Data Standards in Technology**
> Key examples include:
> - **Technical Standards:** [[JSON]], [[XML]] (data formats), [[HTTPS]] (protocols)[4].
> - **Semantic Standards:** [[HL7]] in healthcare for patient data sharing[4].
> - **Industry-Specific Standards:** SWIFT for financial transactions, ISO 27001 for information security management[4][5].
> 
> These standards are vital for fostering innovation, ensuring compliance, and enabling efficient operations in the tech industry.
