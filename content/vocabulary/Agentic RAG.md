## [[Perplexity AI]] explains [[Agentic RAG]]
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances traditional RAG systems by integrating AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks autonomously. These agents retrieve, validate, and synthesize information from diverse sources, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.

### **Capabilities of Agentic RAG**
- **Dynamic Query Handling**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable steps and adapts retrieval strategies in real-time[1][5].
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Uses advanced algorithms for precision and integrates multimodal data like text and images[1][2].
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can use APIs, databases, or analytical tools to enrich responses[2][5].
- **Applications**:
  - Real-time Q&A
  - Customer support automation
  - Data management
  - Healthcare, legal, and financial research[2][5].

### **Technologies for Implementation**
- **Open Source Frameworks**:
  - [[LangChain]]
  - [[LlamaIndex]]
  - [[Arctic Agentic RAG]] (lightweight and modular)[2][3][7].
- **Cloud Platforms**:
  - AWS, Azure, GCP for scalability and deployment[9].

### **Relevant Teams**
- **Customer Support**: For automating FAQs and resolving queries.
- **R&D Teams**: To accelerate innovation with advanced data retrieval.
- **IT Departments**: For technical support optimization.
- **Healthcare & Legal Teams**: For managing complex databases efficiently[4][5].
