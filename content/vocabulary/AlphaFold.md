> [!AI explains:]
> ### The Story of AlphaFold
> 
> **AlphaFold** is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by **DeepMind**, a leading AI research company owned by **Alphabet Inc.** (Google's parent company). It represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in computational biology, having solved the decades-old **protein folding problem** with remarkable accuracy.
> 
> #### The Challenge: The Protein Folding Problem
> 
> Proteins are the building blocks of life, performing countless crucial functions in cells. To function correctly, a protein must fold into a specific 3D shape, which is determined by its sequence of amino acids. However, predicting this shape from the sequence alone has been one of biology's most intractable problems for over 50 years. Despite advances in experimental techniques, determining protein structures in the lab is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming.
> 
> The **Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)** competition was launched in 1994 to evaluate and advance computational methods for accurately predicting protein structures. It became the proving ground where AlphaFold would revolutionize the field.

> ### The Birth of AlphaFold
> 
> AlphaFold was spearheaded by **DeepMind**, an AI research company founded in 2010 and based in London. DeepMind is known for its landmark achievements in AI, such as creating **AlphaGo**, the first AI to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The company leveraged its expertise in machine learning to tackle the protein folding problem.
> 
> **Sponsorship and Support**:
> 
> - DeepMind is funded by **Alphabet Inc.**, which acquired the company in **2014**. Alphabet provided the resources and infrastructure to support DeepMind's ambitious projects, including AlphaFold.
> - The project also benefited from collaborations with academic institutions and researchers in structural biology, who provided insights into the challenges of protein folding.

> ### AlphaFold's Breakthroughs
> 
> #### AlphaFold 1 (CASP13, 2018)
> 
> In the **2018 CASP13 competition**, the first version of AlphaFold demonstrated its potential by achieving the best performance among competing teams, significantly outperforming traditional methods. It used machine learning models to predict protein structures by focusing on the distances between pairs of atoms.
> 
> #### AlphaFold 2 (CASP14, 2020)
> 
> In **2020**, AlphaFold 2 made a historic leap in accuracy during the **CASP14 competition**. For the first time, the system achieved predictions that rivaled the accuracy of experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography for many proteins. Key features of AlphaFold 2 included:
> 
> - **Deep Neural Networks**: AlphaFold 2 employed advanced neural networks trained on massive datasets of protein sequences and structures.
> - **End-to-End Learning**: The system integrated sequence data, structural constraints, and physical principles into a cohesive model.
> - **Attention Mechanisms**: Inspired by advances in natural language processing, AlphaFold used attention mechanisms to understand long-range relationships within protein sequences.
> 
> Its success was hailed as a solution to the protein folding problem, a challenge that had eluded scientists for decades.

> ### Collaboration and Open Science
> 
> In **2021**, DeepMind took a bold step by making AlphaFold's code and predictions freely available to the scientific community. It partnered with the **European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)** to create the **AlphaFold Protein Structure Database**, which contains predicted structures for hundreds of thousands of proteins.
> 
> - By **2022**, the database was expanded to include over **200 million protein structures**, covering nearly every protein known to science.
> - This open-access approach democratized protein structure data, enabling researchers worldwide to accelerate their work in biology, medicine, and biotechnology.
