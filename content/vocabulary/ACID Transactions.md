A behavior of [[Relational Database]]

[[Perplexity AI]] explains [[ACID Transactions]]
ACID transactions are a foundational concept in relational databases, ensuring reliability and consistency in data operations. The acronym stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**, each addressing a critical aspect of transaction management:

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire operation is rolled back, preventing partial updates and maintaining database integrity[1][3].
   
2. **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another while adhering to all predefined rules and constraints. This ensures the database remains accurate and reliable[2][3].

3. **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to execute independently, avoiding conflicts in high-concurrency environments[1][3].

4. **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently stored, even in the event of system failures[1][3].

Experts assess ACID properties when evaluating databases because they are critical for maintaining data integrity, especially in applications like banking or e-commerce where accuracy and reliability are paramount. While relational databases typically implement ACID fully, some NoSQL systems may relax these guarantees to achieve higher scalability and performance[4][6].
