> ### **What Is an ORM?**
> 
> An **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** is a tool or library that acts as a bridge between a relational database and an application, enabling developers to interact with the database using the programming language's objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries. ORMs abstract away the complexity of database interactions by mapping database tables to classes and rows to objects within the application.

> 
> ### **How an ORM Works**
> 
> 1. **Mapping Database Tables to Classes:**
>     
>     - Each table in the database is represented as a class in the application.
>     - Each column in the table becomes an attribute (field) of the class.
> 2. **Mapping Rows to Objects:**
>     
>     - Each row in the table becomes an instance of the mapped class.
> 3. **CRUD Operations:**
>     
>     - ORMs provide methods to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations without requiring raw SQL. For example:
>         - `Create`: Insert a new record into the database by creating an object and saving it.
>         - `Read`: Query the database and retrieve rows that are automatically converted into objects.
>         - `Update`: Modify an object and save it back to the database.
>         - `Delete`: Remove a record by deleting the corresponding object.
> 4. **Query Abstraction:**
>     
>     - ORMs allow developers to write database queries in the application's programming language, often using objects and methods that abstract SQL syntax.

> 
> ### **Why Are ORMs Important?**
> 
> 1. **Reduced Complexity:**
>     
>     - Developers can work with objects instead of learning and writing raw SQL, reducing the cognitive load and potential for errors.
> 2. **Code Maintainability:**
>     
>     - Query logic is embedded in the application code, making it easier to maintain and refactor.
> 3. **Database Agnosticism:**
>     
>     - Many ORMs support multiple database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), making it easier to switch databases if needed.
> 4. **Productivity:**
>     
>     - ORMs automate repetitive tasks like mapping objects to tables, validation, and query generation, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
> 5. **Security:**
>     
>     - By abstracting queries, ORMs help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, as they often use parameterized queries under the hood.
