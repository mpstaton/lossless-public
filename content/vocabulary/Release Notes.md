> [!NOTE] AI Explains [[Release Notes]]
> ### **What Are Release Notes?**
> 
> **Release notes** are documents or announcements created by technology and software companies to communicate updates, changes, and improvements made to a product, application, or software. They provide users and stakeholders with essential information about what has been added, fixed, improved, or removed in a new release. Release notes play a critical role in keeping users informed and engaged while maintaining transparency about the evolution of a product.

> 1. **Transparency:** Helps users understand the changes in the product and the value of updates.
> 2. **[[User Education]]:** Explains new features or changes, enabling users to take full advantage of the updates.
> 3. **Bug Fixes:** Communicates resolved issues to assure users that problems are being actively addressed.
> 4. **Internal [[Documentation]]:** Serves as a historical record for development teams to track progress and changes.
> 5. **[[Customer Support]]:** Reduces support tickets or inquiries by proactively addressing potential confusion about what has changed.

> ### **Common Structure of Release Notes**
> 
> While release notes can vary, they typically follow a standard structure:
> 
> 1. **Title:** Version number and date of the release.
>     - Example: "Release Notes for Version 2.1.0 – February 23, 2025"
> 2. **Introduction:** Brief summary of the release's purpose or highlights.
>     - Example: "This update introduces a new collaboration feature and includes performance improvements."
> 3. **[[Release Notes|Changelog]] or Key Sections:**

>     - **Improvements:** Enhancements to existing features or performance.
>     - **Bug Fixes:** Descriptions of resolved issues or defects.
>     - **Breaking Changes:** Warnings about changes that may require user action.

> ### **Conventions on Version Annotation**
> 
> Software companies commonly follow **[[Semantic Versioning]]** (SemVer) to annotate versions in release notes. SemVer provides a standardized way to indicate the type and scope of changes in a release.
> 
> #### **Semantic Versioning Format:**
> 
> `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
> 
> 1. **MAJOR (X):**
>     - Incremented when there are significant, breaking changes that are incompatible with previous versions.
>     - Example: `1.0.0 → 2.0.0`
> 2. **MINOR (Y):**
>     - Incremented when new features are added in a backward-compatible manner.
>     - Example: `1.1.0 → 1.2.0`
> 3. **PATCH (Z):**
>     - Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes or minor improvements.
>     - Example: `1.1.0 → 1.1.1`
> 4. **Pre-release or Build Metadata (Optional):**
>     - Used for beta versions, release candidates, or custom builds.
>     - Example: `1.2.0-alpha`, `1.2.0-beta.1`, `1.2.0+build.2025`
> 
> #### **Other Conventions:**
> 
> - **CalVer (Calendar Versioning):**
>     - Uses dates to denote versions (e.g., `2025.2.23`).
>     - Often used by teams releasing updates on a fixed schedule.
> - **Incremental Versioning:**
>     - Simple sequential numbering (e.g., `v1`, `v2`, `v3`).
>     - Common for non-technical audiences or simpler projects.
