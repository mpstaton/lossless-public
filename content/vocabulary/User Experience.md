> **The Role of User Experience (UX) in a Product Team**  
> User Experience (UX) is the bridge between human needs and business goals, ensuring that a product isn’t just functional but also intuitive, delightful, and accessible. Within a product team, UX professionals are the advocates for the user, responsible for understanding their behaviors, pain points, and motivations. They design workflows, interfaces, and interactions that allow users to achieve their goals effortlessly while aligning with the product's objectives. UX designers collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders to iterate on designs, run usability tests, and refine the product based on feedback, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience.
