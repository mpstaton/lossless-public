"The S-Curve Adoption model is a framework for understanding how new products or technologies are adopted by consumers or businesses. It is based on the idea that the adoption process follows a predictable pattern, characterized by slow initial growth, a period of rapid acceleration, and a plateau phase where growth slows down. The model is often used to describe the adoption of new technologies, but it can also be applied to other types of products or services." [^2]


## for Project Management

"In the first stages, the project team is coming together, stakeholders are getting on board, and your time is spent planning rather than doing. Once the project is in full swing, growth in project activity — like man-hours — is significantly higher and the steep curve upward continues to grow to form the middle part of the S-shape. The point of maximum activity is called the inflexion point. Consequently, as the project begins to wind down and move to closure, the curve levels out again." [^1]
