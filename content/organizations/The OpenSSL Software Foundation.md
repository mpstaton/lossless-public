The OpenSSL Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the OpenSSL Project, which provides open-source tools for cryptography and secure communication. The Foundation focuses on non-commercial communities, such as individual developers, academic institutions, and open-source distributions, while its sister organization, the OpenSSL Corporation, handles commercial communities[1][5][6].

### Support and Funding
The Foundation relies on donations and sponsorships from individuals, organizations, and governments that extensively use OpenSSL. Major sponsors include companies like Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and The Linux Foundation. These contributions help maintain and enhance the security infrastructure provided by OpenSSL[2][6].

### Activities
The Foundation manages fundraising, application development, security response handling, contributor license agreements, and community engagement. It also oversees the development of cryptographic libraries and protocols like SSL/TLS to ensure secure online communication[1][6][7].

### Other Standards Promoted
In addition to SSL/TLS protocols, OpenSSL supports cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) and promotes related open-source projects like Network Time Protocol (NTP) and OpenSSH through collaborative initiatives[2][7].
