> ### Key Breakthroughs by DeepMind
> 
> #### 1. **Mastering Games**
> 
> DeepMind initially focused on using games as a testing ground for its AI algorithms, as games provide complex yet controlled environments.
> 
> - **Deep Q-Network (DQN, 2013-2015)**:
>     
>     - DeepMind developed an AI capable of playing classic Atari games (like Pong and Breakout) at superhuman levels using reinforcement learning.
>     - DQN was a major breakthrough in combining deep learning with reinforcement learning, allowing the AI to learn directly from raw pixel inputs.
> - **AlphaGo (2016)**:
>     
>     - DeepMind stunned the world when its AI, **AlphaGo**, defeated the world champion Go player **Lee Sedol** in a 4-1 match. Go, a highly complex board game, had long been considered a benchmark for human intelligence.
>     - This achievement was hailed as a milestone in AI, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning and neural networks.
> - **AlphaZero (2017)**:
>     
>     - An evolution of AlphaGo, AlphaZero mastered chess, shogi, and Go from scratch, outperforming the best human and AI players in these games after just hours of self-play.
>     - Unlike traditional AI systems, AlphaZero learned without relying on human knowledge or pre-programmed strategies.
> - **AlphaStar (2019)**:
>     
>     - DeepMind’s AI achieved grandmaster-level performance in **StarCraft II**, a real-time strategy game requiring long-term planning and resource management.
> 
> #### 2. **Solving Protein Folding (AlphaFold, 2020)**
> 
> - DeepMind’s **AlphaFold** solved the decades-old **protein folding problem**, predicting 3D protein structures with near-laboratory accuracy.
> - This breakthrough has transformative implications for biology, medicine, and biotechnology, earning AlphaFold recognition as one of the greatest AI achievements in history.
> 
> #### 3. **AI for Science and Healthcare**
> 
> - **Eye Health**: DeepMind partnered with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to develop AI models capable of diagnosing eye diseases from medical scans with expert-level accuracy.
> - **Kidney Function**: DeepMind created an AI system that could predict acute kidney injury (AKI) up to 48 hours in advance, potentially saving lives.
