Because [[Data Fluidics|data wants to become fluid]] through an explosion of [[REST API|REST APIs]], [[One-Click Integrations]], etc, it's becoming more important to think about the synergies that can be unlocked from [[Stack Compatibility]].

[[Market Standard|Market Standards]] tend to emerge around [[Market Leaders]] that become a central node in the market network. They are also often created and/or maintained through [[Standards Organizations]], [^1] or emerge around [[Open Source]] initiatives. [^2]  

##### Examples of [[Market Leaders]]-driven.
[[ASP.NET]], created and maintained by [[Microsoft]].
[[Angular]], [[Material Design]], [[Go]] created and maintained by [[Google]].
[[React]], [[StyleX]], [[Skip]] created and maintained by [[Meta]].
[[NEXT.js]], [[Nextra]] maintained by [[Vercel]].

##### Examples of [[Standards Organizations]]-driven. 
[[International Color Consortium]] and/or [[OpenGL]].
[[JavaScript]], maintained by [[The Internet Society]]. 


Companies can pursue purposeful efforts like [[Platform Mechanisms]]. However, a lot of other [[Conventions]] arise as many actors try to create their own value by plugging into the hubs of the market network, which functions much like an evolving market ecosystem.  

Big tech leaders purposefully offer compatibility for their preferred partners, or for actors using their preferred conventions. What arises is an operating environment where [[Drag]] or [[Friction]] can be reduced, thus productivity gained, when selecting from technology choices.
