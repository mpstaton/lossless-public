> [!AI describes internal tool builders]
> The **Internal Tool** category of **SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)** platforms focuses on enabling businesses to build custom internal applications and dashboards without requiring significant engineering effort. These tools streamline workflows by allowing teams to create tailored solutions for operations, analytics, customer support, inventory management, and more—often without the need to start from scratch.

> ### **What Are Internal Tool Builders?**
> 
> Internal Tool builders, such as **Retool**, provide pre-built components (tables, forms, charts, buttons, APIs) and integrations with databases or external services. They are designed to:
> 
> - **Accelerate development**: Allow non-developers or small engineering teams to quickly create internal tools.
> - **Reduce complexity**: Abstract away coding-heavy processes like database queries or API integrations.
> - **Enhance flexibility**: Enable customization for unique business workflows.
> - **Integrate seamlessly**: Connect directly to databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), third-party APIs (Stripe, Slack, Salesforce), or custom infrastructure.
> 
> These tools are a hybrid of **low-code/no-code platforms** and **developer-centric customization frameworks**, making them versatile for both technical and non-technical users.
