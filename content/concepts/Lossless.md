Lossless has become a technical term. It refers to algorithmic methods to reduce the size of data presented at the origin point, then apply the methods to data at the point of arrival to reconstruct it perfectly.  When fully Lossless, there is no loss of information. While the algorithmic methods have applications in to many areas to list, the term Lossless has been mostly used in data compression, particularly for audio and video information.
