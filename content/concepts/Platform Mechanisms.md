Becoming a platform is, first and foremost, a mindset and cultural shift within an organization.  
Instead of selling to a market, platforms host a market. Instead of selling a wine, platforms manage a bar.  

Going from selling products and services to managing a platform is common, because most platforms started by gaining significant market positions selling products and services. Why?  Because platforms must attract enough participants to achieve a [[Critical Mass]], and they usually only do so if the organization is already a central part of a market. 

Starting a platform from scratch with no central market position is a fool's errand, while some have succeeded the vast majority did not live to tell the tale. Alternately, transitioning from a market leader to a platform has become a common ambition of notable organizations. There are now playbooks and examples to learn from. The transition is still full of challenges that befuddle even the best business leaders.

Platforms have counter-intuitive design challenges: generally, the most valuable features and capabilities are geared towards attracting and retaining activity between participants -- and a good majority of them are features either no one wants, everyone tries to game, everyone hates, or no one notices. Similar design challenges are likely found in the role of a school headmaster. 

Yet, to become a platform is to create, curate and manage an ecosystem of participants -- to facilitate a hub of market activity. More simply, they must be a conduit for sellers to reach buyers, and buyers to discover and compare sellers; or, providers to be found by seekers, and seekers to find providers. 

So, the transition to platform runs contrary to the organizational trajectory that won a market leadership position.  Rather than directly addressing the needs and wants of a customer, platforms must be thorough in developing and maintaining trust within and among participants.  

Perhaps even more contrary to a market leaders culture is the transition from tight control to barely managed chaos. To become a platform, organizations must let go of some of their vigilance: protecting customers, controlling market share, and upholding the highest quality standards are instincts that will cause discomfort as platforms get off the ground. At their best, platforms often start as barely managed chaos. 

The growth from market leader to platform is to institutionalize the following: to better serve the market, let the unknown come and the unexpected occur. Platforms tend to be more successful if they design for and uphold principles of [[Technology wants to be Emergent|Emergent Innovation]], allowing more or less anyone and any organization to at least try to gain platform access.  It's a [[Come one, come all]] policy.  

The way to best serve customers changes from directly serving them to letting others try, and to create clear, strong, and stable [[Platform Mechanisms]].

## Common Features of a Technology Platform 

- Aligning to the goals of others -- "Promote your thing, reach more people."

- Obsessive [[Documentation]], with a [[Documentation First Development]] methodology. 
	- Clear [[Error Handling]]
- Clear Onramps
	- Ease of [[Getting Started]]
- Trust Heuristics & [[Reputation Systems]]
- Structured Communication Channels
- [[#Developer Community Hub|Developer Community]]
	- Community Bug Reporting
- [[Community Moderation]], including [[Community Moderation#Policy Maintenance|Policy Maintenance]] and  [[Community Moderation#Noise Policing|Noise Policing]]
- [[Frictionless Commerce]]
- Match Making Magic
	- Improved discovery for seekers.  
	- Improved promotion for providers.  [[#Promotion Mechanics|Promotion Mechanics]]
- [[Network Effects]]


## Technology-based Platform Methods
Leading technology companies offer a suite of tools to develop on their platforms, typically called an [[SDK|Software Development Kit]] or [[SDK]]. This includes not just [[Microsoft]], [[Apple]] and [[Android]], but also [[Nvidia]] and other hardware providers.  

### Developer Community Hub
![[Airtable#Airtable Developer Community Hub]]

#### Ease of [[Getting Started]]
Most of the platforms have an obsessive focus on helping people and organizations [[Getting Started|get started]].

![[Astro#Getting Started with Astro]]

![[Tidyverse#Getting Started in the Tidyverse]]

![[Anthropic#Getting started with Anthropic]]

#### Let them find bugs for you:

![[JetBrains#JetBrains has its own community bug reporting system]]

### Let them build for you.

![[Nvidia#Nvidia SDK Manager]]

This is often, but not always, accompanied by an [[App Stores|App Store]]. 

![[Apple#Apple App Store]]


## Unlimited Functionality atop Core Functionality

A modern [[Application Programming Interface]] or [[Application Programming Interface|API]].  This is most often coupled with [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions]] offered through a catalog or marketplace, 

![[Visual Studio Code#VS Code Extensions]]

![[Tooling/Figma#Figma Plug-ins, Add-ons, Extensions Plug-ins]]


Web Browsers also use [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions]], here is an example:
![[Opera#Opera Addons]]
## Data that Moves

Web Applications often have a slightly different way they become a platform -- they focus on [[Data Fluidics|fluid data mobility]] between their service and other services through applying conventions, such as the [[REST API]], and use [[Web Standards]] for authentication and security. 

![[Google#Google has APIs for everything.]]

![[Airtable#Airtable API Docs]]

[[Airtable]] also sports a less common, but extremely helpful, personalized set of [[Documentation]] that allows you to follow the docs with your own data model.  

![[Airtable#Airtable Custom API Docs]]

Thus, instead of having an App Store or an Extension library, they have an [[Integration Library]], that often include [[One-Click Integrations]].  
![[Airtable#Airtable Marketplace]]

## Unlimited Content or Options

[[Input Markets]], or a marketplace of content or tools that can facilitate a user finding and utilizing what they might be looking for.  For example, web-based video editors now offer a marketplace of stock video footage, stock music for a soundtrack, in addition to the video editing tools.  In many ways, this can be thought of as a [[Input Markets#Content Marketplaces|Content Marketplace]]. 


### Promotion Mechanics

![[Udemy#Udemy promotes its Creators through Email Engagement]]




Very Often:
[[Open Source]], using [[GitHub]] as a primary distribution platform to early adopters.
