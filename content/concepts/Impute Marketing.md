In the Biography of [[Steve Jobs]], [[Apple]]'s first investor and then first head of marketing introduced the core principle of Impute. The idea was to get people to buy, marketers need to induce a set of feelings that make them want to buy.  

Thus, marketing is about influencing how people move from perception to feeling. Impute is the opposite of compute. The human mind does not rationally compute all the necessary factors, they perceive many factors all at once, often many that they could not rationally point out and determine, much less influence the decision to purchase.
