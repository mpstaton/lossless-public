A reason we're abstracting things like content marketplaces, is the marketplace concept can be applied to any kind of media, content, files, etc.  The key element is that the service is not just a creator of the input (media, file, format, content, etc), it's a mechanism for professionals to distribute their creations as well. This is why they are often called [[Creators]]
