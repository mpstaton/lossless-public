> [!Ai explains Jobs to be done]
> The **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** framework, popularized by Clayton Christensen, is a concept used to understand **why customers "hire" a product or service** to address their needs. Instead of focusing on product features or customer demographics, JTBD emphasizes the **underlying job customers want to accomplish** and the outcomes they desire. This approach helps businesses innovate and design solutions that genuinely address customer needs.

> ### **Key Concept**
> 
> The central idea is that people don’t buy products or services—they "hire" them to **get a job done**. A "job" represents the progress a customer is trying to make in a specific situation, given their unique context and constraints.
> 
> For example:
> 
> - A person doesn’t buy a drill because they want a drill; they buy it because they need a hole in a wall to hang a picture. The "job to be done" is creating the hole.
>

> 
> ### **Core Principles of JTBD**
> 
> 1. **Focus on the Job, Not the Product**:
>     
>     - Customers are more concerned about solving their problem than the specific features of your product.
>     - Example: People who use ride-sharing apps like Uber are not just looking for transportation—they’re hiring the service to get from point A to point B conveniently, affordably, and safely.
> 2. **Jobs Are Contextual**:
>     
>     - The "job" changes based on the situation, needs, or constraints.
>     - Example: Someone might "hire" coffee in the morning to wake up (functional job) but "hire" it in the afternoon to relax and enjoy a social moment (emotional job).
> 3. **Jobs Have Functional and Emotional Dimensions**:
>     
>     - **Functional jobs**: The practical task or problem being solved (e.g., "I need to clean my house").
>     - **Emotional jobs**: The feelings or identity associated with completing the job (e.g., "I want to feel proud of my clean home").
> 4. **Competing Solutions**:
>     
>     - Jobs to Be Done encourages businesses to think about all the possible products, services, or workarounds customers might "hire" to solve the same problem.
>     - Example: A customer might "hire" a gym membership, a fitness app, or a home workout video to get the job of staying healthy done.

> ### **How JTBD Works in Practice**
> 
> 1. **Understand the Customer’s Job**:
>     
>     - Observe, interview, and empathize to uncover what customers are trying to achieve.
>     - Ask questions like:
>         - "What are you trying to accomplish?"
>         - "What are the challenges or frustrations in your current approach?"
> 2. **Identify the Desired Outcomes**:
>     
>     - Define what success looks like for the customer when the job is completed.
>     - Focus on measurable and emotional outcomes (e.g., convenience, speed, cost savings, confidence).
> 3. **Design Solutions Around the Job**:
>     
>     - Use the insights to create products or services that directly address the job and its constraints.
>     - Example: Spotify addresses the job of "finding and enjoying music effortlessly" by offering curated playlists and personalized recommendations.

> ### **Examples of Jobs to Be Done**
> 
> 1. **Milkshake Study** (Christensen's famous example):
>     
>     - A fast-food chain wanted to increase milkshake sales. After studying their customers, they found people often bought milkshakes in the morning to "hire" them for a specific job: making their boring morning commute more enjoyable while being easy to consume with one hand. By focusing on the job (not just the product), the chain made thicker milkshakes that lasted longer and were more satisfying, boosting sales.
> 2. **Apple’s iPod**:
>     
>     - The iPod wasn’t just about storing music; it was "hired" for the job of "giving people access to their music library anytime, anywhere," combined with the emotional satisfaction of owning a sleek, innovative device.
> 3. **Airbnb**:
>     
>     - Travelers "hire" Airbnb to get the job of finding affordable, unique, and local accommodations that provide a different experience than traditional hotels.
>

> ### **Why JTBD Matters for Innovation**
> 
> 1. **Avoids Feature Creep**:
>     
>     - By focusing on the job rather than overloading a product with unnecessary features, businesses can create streamlined, customer-centric solutions.
> 2. **Encourages Differentiation**:
>     
>     - JTBD helps identify unmet needs or overlooked customer jobs, allowing businesses to stand out with innovative solutions.
> 3. **Builds Emotional Connections**:
>     
>     - Addressing both functional and emotional jobs creates deeper loyalty and satisfaction.
> 4. **Expands Market Understanding**:
>     
>     - Thinking in terms of jobs broadens the competitive landscape, helping businesses see indirect competitors or alternative solutions.

> ### **Conclusion**
> 
> The **Jobs to Be Done** framework shifts the focus from products or customer profiles to the **progress customers are trying to make** in their lives. By understanding the "jobs" customers need to get done, businesses can design better products and services, foster meaningful innovation, and create solutions that resonate deeply with customers' needs and desires. It’s a powerful tool for aligning innovation with what truly matters to customers.
