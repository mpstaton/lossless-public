According to [[Poe AI]]:

> [!AI describes the Theory of Constraints]
> The **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** is a management philosophy that identifies the most critical limiting factor (the "constraint") in a process and focuses efforts on improving or eliminating it to increase overall efficiency and productivity. In essence, TOC emphasizes that the performance of any system is determined by its weakest link—just like how the speed of a convoy is limited by its slowest vehicle.
> 
> ### **The Core Principles of TOC**
> 
> 1. **Every system has a constraint**: Whether it’s a bottleneck in production, a limited resource, or a policy, every system has at least one factor that restricts its output.
> 2. **Focus on the constraint**: Improving the constraint is the fastest way to enhance the system’s performance.
> 3. **Optimizing non-constraints won’t improve the system**: If efforts are spent improving areas that aren’t the bottleneck, they won’t affect the overall output because the constraint still governs performance.

> ### **Why Investing Outside the Primary Constraint Is Inefficient**
> 
> Imagine a factory with an assembly line where one machine processes 100 units per hour, while the downstream packaging station can only handle 50 units per hour. In this scenario, the packaging station is the constraint—it limits the total production capacity.
> 
> Now, if you invest heavily in upgrading the faster machine to process 200 units per hour, the constraint (the packaging station) remains unchanged, so the factory’s output is still stuck at 50 units per hour. This extra investment in the non-constraint doesn’t increase throughput; instead, it results in wasted capital, idle capacity, and potentially higher operating costs for the overperforming machine.
> 
> This principle applies broadly:
> 
> - In **manufacturing**, investing in non-constrained machines creates bottlenecks elsewhere.
> - In **software development**, hiring additional developers won’t help if the slowest part of the process is testing.
> - In **supply chains**, adding inventory won’t improve delivery speed if transportation logistics are the bottleneck.

> ### **Efficient Use of Capital According to TOC**
> 
> To achieve the best results, organizations should focus their investments and efforts on:
> 
> 1. **Identifying the constraint**: Pinpoint the factor that limits performance.
> 2. **Exploiting the constraint**: Maximize the efficiency of the constraint with existing resources.
> 3. **Subordinating everything else**: Align all other processes to support the constraint.
> 4. **Elevating the constraint**: Invest strategically to increase the capacity of the constraint.
> 5. **Repeating the process**: Once the constraint is resolved, a new one will emerge, and the cycle continues.
> 
> By channeling resources toward the actual bottleneck, organizations can unlock higher productivity and avoid the inefficiencies of overinvesting in areas that don’t directly impact the system’s output.
