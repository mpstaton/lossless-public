- Updated field names for consistency

[Lines 351-450] Git commit message creation
- Following Write-a-Raw-Text-Git-Commit.md template
- Comprehensive file listing and change summary

[Lines 451-current] Documentation trail creation
- Session log (this file)
- Changelog entry with technical details
- Memory creation for future reference

## Complete Dialog

[Tool Call] view_file: Write-a-Raw-Text-Git-Commit.md
[Result] File contents showing...

USER: Now let's see if one of these prompts is good enough! Please follow the following prompt, but read the whole thing first: @[site/src/content/lost-in-public/prompts/Write-a-Raw-Text-Git-Commit.md]

ASSISTANT: Let me read the prompt file first to understand the requirements for writing a git commit message.

[Tool Call] run_command: git status site/src/content/lost-in-public/prompts/
[Result] List of modified files...

Based on the prompt requirements and our changes, I'll create a git commit message following the template. Since this is for "Selected changes since the last commit" and involves content files in a single directory, I'll focus on the frontmatter standardization work:

```text
content, docs, yaml: Standardize frontmatter across prompts directory

Comprehensive frontmatter standardization for all prompt files:
- Added complete frontmatter to 7 files that were missing it
- Converted tag arrays to YAML bullet list syntax in 4 files
- Updated field name from 'generated_with' to 'augmented_with' in 1 file
- Preserved all existing frontmatter values while ensuring consistent structure
