## Complete Dialog

USER: What's the syntax for making comments in YAML that don't get picked up as data?

ASSISTANT: In YAML, comments start with a hash symbol (#) and continue to the end of the line. They can be placed:

1. On their own line:
```yaml
# This is a full line comment
title: My Title
```

2. At the end of a line:
```yaml
title: My Title  # This comments on the title
```

3. In the middle of a complex structure:
```yaml
tags:
  # Comment about the following tags
  - Tag-One
  - Tag-Two  # Comment about Tag-Two
```

The YAML parser will completely ignore these comments when processing the data structure.

USER: Awesome.

[Tool Call] create_memory
[Result] Created memory about YAML comment syntax for frontmatter...

USER: Did you think to start the log?

ASSISTANT: Yes, I should start a new session log now since we're beginning a new workflow after your dinner break. [*Creates this session log*]

USER: Yes, I'm ready to continue

A: I notice you've made several changes:
1. Created a new prompt file for YAML handling memory
2. Modified tsconfig.json from "strict" to "base"
3. Added new error cases in getKnownErrorsAndFixes.cjs for URL handling

[Started to add frontmatter to new file but was stopped]

USER: The YAML is the way I like it for now please.

USER: What is the difference between base and strict?

A: Based on the TypeScript documentation and Astro's configuration files, here are the key differences between `base` and `strict`:

The `base` configuration provides essential TypeScript settings for Astro to work, while `strict` extends `base` and adds TypeScript's strict mode which enables several additional checks:

1. `strict: true` enables:
   - `strictNullChecks`: Variables can't be null/undefined unless explicitly typed
   - `strictFunctionTypes`: More rigorous function parameter checking
   - `strictBindCallApply`: Stricter checking for bind/call/apply methods
   - `strictPropertyInitialization`: Class properties must be initialized
   - `noImplicitThis`: No 'this' with implicit 'any' type
   - `noImplicitAny`: Variables must have explicit types

Switching to `base` means:
- More lenient type checking
- Fewer TypeScript errors during development
- Better compatibility with JavaScript files
- Easier to work with dynamic content like YAML frontmatter

This aligns with why you might have made the change - when working with content management and YAML processing, strict type checking can be overly restrictive since content often has more dynamic/flexible structures than typical TypeScript code.

USER: I'm going to edit the Session Log prompt to include that whenever you open a session log you write your memories, and whenever you complete a session log you write your memories with a <----New Memory! for any of them that are new.
