Okay, I'm trying to understand how DeepSeek can help with my previous video on automating business processes. In the first part, I talked about using DeepSeek to process transaction details from credit card statements, extracting vendor names, total amounts, and currency. Now that I've looked at the comparison with ChatGPT 4.0, I want to make sure I grasp how both tools handle this kind of task.

So, in my example, DeepSeek provided a lot of reasoning but lost track of the objective if it couldn't determine the currency. On the other hand, ChatGPT 4.0 also got confused and didn't provide the structured data I needed. Both have similar performance, which is good, but they each have their own issues.

I'm thinking about how this applies to a real business scenario where thousands of credit card statements need processing quickly and accurately. If DeepSeek isn't as consistent in providing structured data without losing context, it might be problematic. But since both are open-source and don't require licensing, maybe that's acceptable for the demo purpose.

Also, I'm curious about other tools that offer similar benefits but perhaps have different features or limitations. How do they stack up against each other? Maybe someone with more experience could compare them better to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

DeepSeek is an open-source AI model designed for complex reasoning tasks like transaction processing, as demonstrated in your demo. While it provided structured data by default, its performance can be influenced by factors such as context loss when dealing with ambiguous information. In comparison to ChatGPT 4.0, both have similar handling of structured data and reasoning but may differ in response consistency and formatting.

For a real-world application scenario involving processing thousands of credit card statements:
- **DeepSeek** is suitable for its ability to handle structured data without losing context.
- **ChatGPT 4.0** might offer better consistency and clarity, though it's not required for the demo.

Both tools are open-source and free, making them accessible for trials or learning scenarios.
