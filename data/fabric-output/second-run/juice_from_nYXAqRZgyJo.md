Alright, I need to figure out how to extract information from the given text. Let me start by reading through the input carefully.

The user provided a detailed step-by-step guide on deploying 20 CRM using Dollar Deploy. The text is quite lengthy, but it's all about setting up an application, managing billing details, and so on. 

First, I'll break down what needs to be extracted: IDEAS, INSIGHTS, HABITS, FACTS, ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY, RECOMMENDATIONS.

Starting with IDEAS, the text mentions several CRM deployment steps like launching the app, managing billing, etc. I need to extract the most surprising and insightful ideas here. The key points are the setup process, user management, billing details, analytics features, security, multi-user capabilities, pricing, customization, and community support.

Next, INSIGHTS section requires refining these ideas into more focused insights. This would involve specifics like automated notifications, predictive analytics for customer behavior, secure messaging for compliance, advanced chatbot integration, multi-language support, and community-driven recommendations.

HABITS are actionable steps related to using the application. These include logging in regularly, reviewing billing statements promptly, checking account status updates on your phone, ensuring security protocols are followed, staying updated with new features, collaborating with others, seeking feedback, using templates for quick setup, managing multiple users, and participating in community discussions.

FACTS should cover specific details like pricing options, supported languages, secure messaging protocols, advanced analytics integration, and the ability to create custom templates. 

One-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY is a concise summary that encapsulates the main takeaway from the video. It would likely mention the ease of setup, quick launch with a template, and the comprehensive features offered.

Finally, RECOMMENDATIONS are actionable steps for users based on insights and habits. This includes regular logging in, prompt billing checks, secure practices, staying updated, effective collaboration, feedback mechanisms, customizing templates, managing users, and engaging community.

I need to ensure that each section has at least 20 IDEAS, with some being more specific as they should be detailed. The INSIGHTS should have fewer but more focused ideas. HABITS should be actionable and practical. FACTS are specific details about the features or pricing. Takeaway is a concise summary of what users can expect. Recommendations are clear steps to take.

I also need to make sure there are no repeated phrases, bullets in the wrong order, or any markdown formatting beyond what's specified.
