Okay, let's break this down. The user provided a detailed explanation of how they went through various research tools like Deep Research, Perplexity, Gemini, Google Workspace, AI Playbook, and LinkedIn. They went step by step, from researching trends to strategy to comparing tools for deeper insights.

First, I noticed the user was on Deep Research but then realized they had already recorded a video about it, which might have been behind-the-scenes info. So, my response should reflect that without going into details of Gemini's features since I don't have access to real-time updates or proprietary information.

Next, looking at Perplexity and how the user compared it with Deep Research, I saw they were on a roll, using both tools for different aspects of research. The goal was to leverage AI for marketing strategies, which makes sense because both provided deep insights but in different waysâ€”Deep Research for trends and Perplexity for strategy.

The user also mentioned Google Workspace integration, so I should highlight how Gemini is integrated there, emphasizing the $2 extra per month. They were excited about using both tools together to get comprehensive research support without breaking their workday.

Finally, they linked LinkedIn as a resource but didn't go into depth. Since they had already spoken about AI in marketing, it's important to connect that with LinkedIn, maybe mentioning industry-specific insights or case studies there.

Overall, the user was thorough and clear, providing a logical progression through tools and comparisons. I should thank them for being so proactive and ensure their video highlights these key points without overstepping into proprietary details.

Alright, I understand you're on Deep Research but looking to get more detailed insights. Let me help clarify some of the points in your explanation.

### 1. **Deep Research vs. Perplexity**
   - **Deep Research**: This is where we collect data and analyze trends in depth using AI. We use tools like Gemini, which provide structured reports with multiple sources.
   - **Perplexity**: While Perplexity offers quick research results similar to Deep Research, it's more suited for light research or exploratory questions. It may not delve as deeply into trends or insights.

### 2. **Gemini Integration**
   - Gemini is integrated into Google Workspace for both AI and marketing teams. It provides access to the latest AI tools like Deep Research.
   - The cost of Gemini is $19/month, which includes all AI features plus any additional tools you might need (though some are free).

### 3. **Google Playbook**
   - If you're using AI for marketing strategy in Google Playbooks, you can leverage Perplexity to explore more targeted research questions. It's a good resource for quick insights and comparisons.

### 4. **Social Media Insights**
   - Deep Research gives you access to global trends from platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. For your LinkedIn research, I'd recommend using tools like **LinkedIn Insights** or **Mashable**, which provide in-depth analysis on social media topics.

### 5. **Final Thoughts**
   - You're already doing a great job with Deep Research for marketing strategy. If you want to dig deeper into trends and competitor behavior, Perplexity is worth exploring further.
   - The integration of Gemini into Google Workspace will make AI resources more accessible if you need them on your end.
