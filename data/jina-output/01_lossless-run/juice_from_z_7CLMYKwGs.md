Alright, so I need to figure out how to get AI to correctly handle authentication when it generates code. The user mentioned using a prompt framework where they can specify what the code needs to do, even if it doesn't have to include all the implementation details. They also talked about using tools like typescript and its type system.

First, I'll need to understand how the prompt framework works. It seems like you can create a set of rules or constraints that AI must follow when generating code. This means defining what exactly the code needs to do beyond just producing the output. For authentication purposes, this could involve specifying necessary functions or interactions between different parts of the code.

I should think about which specific requirements need to be included in these rules. For example, authentication might require users to log in before accessing certain services, handle tokens, and verify identities. These are separate from implementation details like how the login form is structured or error handling mechanisms.

Next, I'll need to structure these rules in a way that's understandable to AI. It should be specific enough to guide AI towards producing correct authentication code but flexible enough not to overcomplicate things. Maybe using keywords and phrases related to authentication functions, such as "login," "token," "verify," etc., would help.

I also need to consider how these rules are integrated into the AI's interaction with the code generation process. Perhaps it's best to separate the specification of what needs to be done from the actual execution of the code. The AI can understand that a function is required for authentication and then generate the code accordingly, but not necessarily knowing all the implementation details.

Testing would be another important aspect. I should ensure that the specified rules result in correct authentication behavior. For instance, if the login function is defined as "function loginUser() { ... }," it's crucial that AI knows to produce a code block with this function and handle any errors or exceptions properly.

Also, I need to think about how to handle different user roles or environments. Authentication might vary based on whether a user is logged in vs not, but the framework should still be adaptable by specifying separate rules for each role.

I should also consider edge cases. What if authentication isn't required? Then the AI shouldn't generate any login code. Similarly, if there are specific security protocols that need to be followed, those can be included in the rules as well.

In terms of implementation, I might use a tool or framework that allows me to write these rules explicitly. For example, in Python, I could define a class with required methods for authentication and then generate code that includes such functions. But since the user is using TypeScript and its type system, maybe I can leverage that to create more precise specifications.

Another consideration is how this affects other functionalities. If authentication is one of many required functions, making it explicit helps AI avoid missing any necessary parts or including irrelevant ones during generation.

I should also reflect on future steps. As AI becomes better at generating code, the requirement for specified authentication rules might become even more critical. It's important to continue refining these rules based on how well AI handles them as it evolves.

Lastly, I need to ensure that this approach doesn't limit the creativity of AI. By specifying what needs to be done, it forces AI to produce code in a structured way, which can enhance reliability and consistency in authentication within the generated code.

To achieve accurate authentication when generating code, follow these organized steps:

1. **Define Clear Rules:**
   - Create explicit rules that specify necessary functions or interactions for authentication without including implementation details.
   - Use keywords like "login," "token," "verify," and ensure separate rules for different user roles.

2. **Integrate with Code Generation:**
   - Structure the rules to guide AI towards producing correct authentication code, allowing it to understand dependencies on specific functions.

3. **Separate Specification from Execution:**
   - Define what needs to be done (e.g., login function) before generating actual code.
   - This separation reduces complexity and ensures AI follows the necessary constraints without needing detailed implementation specifics.

4. **Test and Validate:**
   - Ensure that specified rules result in correct authentication behavior, testing for error handling and exception propagation as needed.

5. **Adapt to Role and Environment:**
   - Include role-specific rules (e.g., different functions for logged-in vs unauthenticated users) and adjust security protocols accordingly.

6. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Specify required rules for authentication scenarios or handle absence of necessary functions gracefully.

7. **Use Tools for Explicit Rules:**
   - Utilize TypeScript tools to write explicit rules, ensuring structured output that aligns with the specified requirements.

8. **Consider Future Improvements:**
   - Continue refining rules as AI enhances code generation capabilities, maintaining reliability and consistency in authentication.

By structuring these elements clearly and explicitly, you enhance AI's reliability while allowing creativity through specific guidance.
