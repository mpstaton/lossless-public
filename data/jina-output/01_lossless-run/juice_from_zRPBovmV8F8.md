Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to use this 03 mini tool. I've just started playing around with it, and while it's cool, I'm not entirely sure what all the features are or how they work together. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the main interface is pretty clean—there's a header with some buttons like "New Document," "Ask Query," and "Research." The title says it can do various things like financial analysis, legal stuff, scientific papers, etc., which sounds pretty versatile. I'm especially interested in how to use the "Ask Query" feature because that seems like something people might need for research or problem-solving.

When I click "New Document," it creates a new page with some basic placeholders. The "Ask Query" button just adds a line at the end of the document, and then I can start typing my query there. For example, if someone wants to calculate the area of a circle given its radius, they could type something like "Area = πr² where r = 5 units." The tool should compute that for them quickly.

But wait, when I first started using it, it didn't seem to function as expected. The results were either too off or I had to spend way more time tweaking things to get the answers right. Maybe the AI isn't always sure about something? Or perhaps there's a learning curve with the queries I need to write?

I noticed that the examples provided in the help section weren't very detailed. Sometimes, people just say "calculate" without explaining what they want—like if someone wants to solve an equation or analyze data. The AI didn't always provide enough context or step-by-step instructions, which is frustrating.

Also, when I tried using it for something like solving a system of equations, the AI kept giving me partial answers and not linking them together properly. It seemed like it was all jumbled up without any clear structure. That made me think that maybe the AI needs more guidance or that the way it processes information is a bit too linear.

Another thing I noticed is that the research section didn't seem to be very functional at all. I could only access it by using some advanced features, like setting the document as a research page and then writing something in the placeholder area. But even when I did that, the AI didn't provide meaningful insights or suggestions. It just gave me generic advice without any depth.

I also found it challenging to create detailed proofs for mathematical problems. The AI often jumped into calculations without fully fleshing out the reasoning behind each step. This made it hard for users who wanted to understand not just get the answer but how it was derived.

Maybe I'm using 03 mini in the wrong way, or perhaps it's intended for specific types of tasks that aren't common enough to make people use it frequently. It would be cool if there were more tutorials or examples showing how to optimize queries and research sections further. Also, seeing a community or forum where users discuss their experiences with 03 mini could be really helpful.

Another thought is about the integration with other tools. If someone uses 03 mini for something like data analysis, would it work seamlessly with other AI platforms? Or does it require custom coding to use its advanced features?

Overall, while I'm impressed by 03 mini's capabilities, there are definitely areas where users could improve efficiency and get more detailed guidance. It might take some time and practice to harness all the features effectively.

To maximize your experience with 03 mini, consider the following organized approach:

1. **Understand the AI's Functionality:**
   - Focus on using "Ask Query" for research or problem-solving tasks. Experiment with different queries, such as mathematical equations or logical statements, to see how it processes information.

2. **Leverage Advanced Features:**
   - Explore integrating 03 mini into other tools by setting the document as a research page and writing relevant queries there.
   - Utilize the "New Document" feature for creating structured pages with placeholders where users can input their specific needs or calculations.

3. **Optimize Your Experience:**
   - Review how AI handles examples; ensure they are clear and provide context, even if it's brief.
   - When using research sections, avoid jumping too far into the process by starting with placeholder areas and refining your questions as you iterate.

4. **Seek Community Support:**
   - Engage with forums or communities where users share experiences and tips. This can provide insights into how others are optimizing their use of 03 mini.

5. **Enhance Learning Through Tutorials:**
   - Look for tutorials that explain advanced features, such as optimizing queries and research sections, to guide your usage effectively.

By systematically exploring these areas, you can unlock the full potential of 03 mini, enhancing both efficiency and user satisfaction with its capabilities.
