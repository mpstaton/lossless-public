Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user shared a detailed article about the end of programming and AI in the future, but they're not happy with it. They found some criticisms like "hard one engineering wisdom" and things getting forgotten. So, maybe the user is looking for a more polished or different perspective.

I need to acknowledge their feedback without dismissing them entirely. Perhaps suggest adding more structure or examples to make the ideas clearer. Maybe mention how AI will shape traditional fields differently by emphasizing critical thinking over continuous practice.

Also, I should offer alternatives if they want. Like mentioning tools or workflows that can bridge these gaps, or using critical thinking exercises in other areas such as math or writing.

I should keep it friendly and open-ended so the user feels comfortable offering further thoughts.

That's a great observation! The article you shared is insightful, but I do think there could be some room for improvement. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Clarify the Point**: You might want to add more explicit guidance on how AI will shape traditional fields by emphasizing critical thinking over continuous practice. This is often referred to as "small critical thinking" versus "large skills."

2. **Add Context**: Perhaps include some examples of specific tasks where AI will help individuals develop their critical thinking skills (e.g., chess or problem-solving workshops) before they learn formal engineering skills.

3. **Include a Framework**: Maybe break down the concept into smaller, more digestible parts to give readers a clearer picture of how it all ties together.

4. **Compare with Current Trends**: Highlight areas where AI is already making impacts that could be seen as a replacement for traditional programming skillsâ€”like in writing, math, or even creative fields.

If you're looking for an alternative perspective, I'd suggest focusing on these areas and offering to explore them further!
