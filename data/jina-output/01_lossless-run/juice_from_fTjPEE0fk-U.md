Okay, I'm trying to understand what DeepSeek R1 does. From what I gather, it's some kind of AI model developed by DeepSeek. They have R1, which is a reasoning model. So R1 might help answer questions that require thinking beyond just giving the answer. The mention of V3 and the original text says V3 was an initial large language model, but R1 seems to be a more refined version.

I'm a bit confused about how R1 works exactly. The description mentions it's built on top of V3 by DeepSeek. It uses reinforcement learning to generate solutions for problems, then applies a rule-based reward system. After that, they distill the reasoning into smaller models called R1, V2, and so on.

The training cost is expensive at $5.6 million, but they mention abating all optimizations to validate their decisions. They processed 15 trillion tokens of data, which sounds massive. The AI community benefits from this because it's a big step in open research and allows for new players like Hugging Face to contribute.

I'm not entirely sure how exactly the reasoning is extracted into smaller models like R1. Is it about taking the high-level understanding from V3 and refining it specifically for reasoning tasks? That would make sense, as reasoning skills are crucial for various applications beyond just answering questions.

The mention of Hugging Face's involvement shows that this isn't just DeepSeek alone; there's community support too. The video talks about how this is leveling the field and making more players available, like universities joining in their research efforts.

I'm still a bit unclear on the specifics of how R1 processes inputs. Is it taking multiple questions and generating detailed reasoning steps for each? Also, the reinforcement learning partâ€”how does that work exactly? Are they using some kind of curriculum or progressive tasks?

The mention of 15 trillion tokens suggests a massive amount of data processed during training, which would be challenging but possible with specialized hardware. The use of tools like PTX (programmed translation) makes sense because it's an intermediate instruction set needed for efficient execution on GPUs.

Overall, R1 seems to enhance the capabilities of the initial large model V3 by adding reasoning and making it more suitable for a wider range of tasks. It's part of DeepSeek's ongoing research efforts to push the boundaries of AI technology while being accessible to others through their models.
