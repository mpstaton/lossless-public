Alright, so Ray Fernando is talking about DeepSeek's AI prompting and reasoning models. He mentions something called "Ray fernando 1337," which is his YouTube channel. I remember that from his recent videos where he plays with these models and explains things. He also talks about how the models are running locally on Macs using Docker and Web UI, but it's a bit complicated.

He starts by discussing how to get started with prompting, data privacy, and inference. Then he delves into the Apollo app for inferences. I think that was mentioned as a paid service. But Ray is encouraging people to explore these models and see if they can find interesting use cases or ideas.

He also mentions his "DeepSeek Play," which I believe is an interactive experience with the models, but it's not yet live on YouTube. That's probably because the models need more development before being used in real-time interactions.

Ray emphasizes the power of prompting and reasoning for multi-million dollar projects and connects to other platforms like DeepSeek's official website or YouTube channel. He invites people to subscribe and comment, saying they're all still learning about this technology.

He adds that while some might be overwhelmed by the complexity, it doesn't mean they can't find their voice in these models. It just requires a willingness to explore and share their thoughts with the community.

In the end, Ray ends with a fun joke mentioning "The Great Pyramids of Time" as a metaphor for understanding AI and its implications. I think that's a nice way to wrap up his show, highlighting both the potential and challenges of this futuristic technology.

Ray Fernando is on an engaging episode about DeepSeek's AI prompting models. Here are the key points he covers:

1. **Prompts and Reasoning Models**: Ray introduces DeepSeek's AI reasoning models, which use prompts to generate responses based on data. These models are powerful tools for understanding complex information.

2. **Data Privacy and Inference**: He discusses how these models can be used responsibly, emphasizing data privacy and ensuring that the models don't infringe upon user information unless necessary.

3. **Apollo App**: Ray mentions DeepSeek's Apollo app, a paid service for inferences on Macs using Docker and Web UI, which is still under development. This allows users to run these models locally but may not offer real-time interaction yet.

4. **Ray fernando 1337**: He shares his YouTube channel, "Ray Fernando 1337," where he explores these AI models interactively. The content covers both the challenges and opportunities of using AI for innovation.

5. **DeepSeek Play**: Ray introduces a feature called "DeepSeek Play," an interactive experience with the models. While not live yet, it aims to demonstrate how these models can engage users in creative ways.

6. **Community Engagement**: He encourages viewers to subscribe on YouTube and comment on his channel, highlighting that while complex, there's potential for understanding AI without being overwhelmed.

7. **Metaphor for Understanding**: Ray uses humor to illustrate the metaphor of "The Great Pyramids of Time," suggesting that understanding AI is similar to building a pyramid but requires patience and curiosity.

Overall, Ray emphasizes the transformative potential of AI reasoning models while encouraging exploration and sharing with the community, fostering a sense of discovery.
