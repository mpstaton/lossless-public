Problem

Why automate Kubernetes?
------------------------

### Resource optimization

A manual approach leads to wasted resources, high costs, and complexity at scale.

### Security

Kubernetes’ dynamic nature complicates compliance and slows remediation.

### DevOps efficiency

Balancing performance and cost is a challenge and causes DevOps toil.

Solution

Case study

#### Akamai achieves 40-70% cloud savings, boosts engineer productivity

[Read the case study](https://cast.ai/case-studies/akamai/)

“I had an aha moment – an iPhone moment – with Cast. Literally two minutes into the integration, we saw the cost analytics, and I had an insight into something I had never had before and had tried to get for a very long time.”

### Yotpo automates Spot Instances, cuts 40% in cloud costs and saves time

[Read the case study](https://cast.ai/case-studies/yotpo/)

“And with Cast AI, we didn’t do anything. Like, we didn’t do the move before, we didn’t do the move after. So there was a lot of human resources and time saved here. That was a very good experience. And again, from a cost perspective, it was highly optimized.”

### Bede Gaming automatically optimizes K8s workloads with no risk to performance

[Read the case study](https://cast.ai/case-studies/bede-gaming/)

“In my mind, it’s one less thing to worry about, and therefore teams can be focused on other things of potentially higher value. So having \[Cast AI\] just run in the background with a good level of confidence that we’re running as efficiently as we can, balancing the service that we’re providing – that’s great.”

**Abhiroop Soni**

Staff Engineer – DevOps at ShareChat

“I don’t have to do anything manually and we’re close to 98% commitment utilization. I used to do capacity planning twice a week for CUD management – now I do that once every two months.”

“We already during the POC, were able to reduce the Instance Costs by arround 30%, so the product payed for itself. Because of that it was very easy to convince the management to buy the product.”

**Achi Solomon**

Director of DevOps at Yotpo

“The ROI was great right from the start. Reducing 40% of our compute costs just by migrating our workloads to Cast AI—that’s huge. And we haven’t even utilized all the CAST features up until now, just the automated instance selection, bin packing, and Spot instance automation.”

“Cast does a great job at optimizing the workload, thus reducing the cloud costs. we were pretty optimized already and it still saved us around 30-40% of the total costs(!).”

**Dekel Shavit**

Senior Director of Engineering at Akamai

“For our use case, CAST was not two times better or five times better. It was immeasurably better.”
