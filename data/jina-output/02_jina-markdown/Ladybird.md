About Ladybird
--------------

Ladybird is a brand-new browser & web engine. Driven by a web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with good performance, stability and security.

From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.

Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.

What makes Ladybird unique
--------------------------

#### Singular focus

We are focused on one thing: the web browser.

![Image 6: crossed out money symbol](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/no-monetization.svg)

#### No monetization

No "default search deals", crypto tokens, or other forms of user monetization, ever.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

?

When is it coming?

We are targeting Summer 2026 for a first Alpha version on Linux and macOS. This will be aimed at developers and early adopters.

?

How many people are working on the browser today?

We currently have 7 paid full-time engineers working on Ladybird. There is also a large community of volunteer contributors.

?

What's the hiring plan?

We are growing the team at a reasonable pace, as budget allows. Building the right team is more important than building it quickly.  
  
We will strive to maintain 18 months of runway at all times.

?

What does "No code from other browsers" really mean?

The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser engine from the ground up. We don't use code from Blink, WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser engine.  
  
For historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries from the SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of writing _everything_ from scratch. Now that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no longer bound by this culture, and we will be making use of 3rd party libraries for common functionality (e.g image/audio/video formats, encryption, graphics, etc.)  
  
We are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries that other browsers use, but we will never adopt another browser engine instead of building our own.

?

Will Ladybird work on Windows?

We don't have anyone actively working on Windows support, and there are considerable changes required to make it work well outside a Unix-like environment.  
  
We would like to do Windows eventually, but it's not a priority at the moment.

?

Will Ladybird work on mobile devices?

We don't have anyone actively working on an Android or iOS port. More effort will be put into mobile once we have the desktop versions in a good state.  
  
While there is the start of an Android port in the project repository, mobile is not a priority at the moment.

?

What are the sponsor tiers?

<table class="sponsor-tiers"><tbody><tr><td>Platinum</td><td>USD $100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>USD $50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>USD $10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>USD $5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Copper</td><td>USD $1,000 (no logo, text only)</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
Sponsorships run for one year, then you are welcome to renew.  
  
Sponsors will have their logos/names displayed on our website, and will be thanked in updates / on social media.  
  
Please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org) if you are interested in sponsorship.

?

How can you be "independent" if you have sponsors?

All sponsorships are in the form of unrestricted donations. Board seats and other forms of influence are not for sale.

?

Why build a new browser in C++ when safer and more modern languages are available?

Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++. The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience. Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.  
  
However, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project, all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect.  
  
We have evaluated a number of alternatives, and will begin incremental adoption of [Swift](https://swift.org/) as a successor language, once Swift version 6 is released. ([More background.](https://x.com/awesomekling/status/1822236888188498031))
