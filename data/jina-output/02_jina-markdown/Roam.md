What People are Saying
======================

The most exciting piece of software I've yet tried... A replacement for the essay... has the potential to be as profound a mental prosthetic as hypertext.

Sarah Constantin

Executive Director, The Longevity Research Institute

The thing that's delighted me most about Roam has been how having it open in a tab affects my entire attitude about research. I feel like I'm playing learning: the video game.

Chelsea Voss

Member of Technical Staff, OpenAI

Roam has enabled me to stop segmenting and limiting my thoughts before I’ve even fleshed them out. This flexibility has freed me up to write 3x more daily content than ever before.

Mansi Jain

Stanford, Class of 2019

Roam is the productivity tool that I didn't know I needed. It helps me organize thoughts and reduce the clutter in my head, something no productivity or organization tool has ever offered me before.

Sam Davis

Researcher, Stanford University Department of Applied Physics

It took me 36 years and a dozen failed "systems" in different apps to figure out that knowledge is organized associatively, not hierarchically. Breakthroughs: bullet journal in Workflowy, then wiki in Bear, now daily auto-back-linked-wiki interconnected brain dumps in Roam.

Marcin Ignac

Founder, Variable.io

Roam is amazing, note-writing on a totally new level - frictionless yet cohesive in a way that Evernote hasn't quite reached for me.

Huan Win

Project Engineer, Halleck-Willard

#### About

We believe that writing is a tool for thinking. If we can build a tool for helping people write and organize their ideas more effectively, we can help them have better thoughts and solve otherwise intractable problems.
