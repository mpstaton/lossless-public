Why use multiple apps when Whimsical does it better?
----------------------------------------------------

From brainstorm to launch—create, plan, and communicate in one interconnected workspace.

[Boards](https://whimsical.com/#boards)[Docs](https://whimsical.com/#docs)[Projects](https://whimsical.com/#projects)[Posts](https://whimsical.com/#posts)

**Boards** are the perfect place to express ideas with mind maps, flowcharts, wireframes, and more.

Sticky notes, voting, and timers makes boards great for retros and workshops, too.

**Docs** are where ideas become plans. Create shared notes, write PRDs, embed boards into docs to add important context, and align your team before you build.

**Projects** are a thoughtfully designed project management tool connected to all your other content in Whimsical so you can work calmer and ship faster.

**Posts** keep everyone in sync with project updates, team check-ins, feedback requests, and more. Automatically share posts to Slack for greater visibility.

Can’t get over how excellent **@Whimsical** is. We use it religiously for wireframing and thought-vomit. I’m not sure I can think without it— a true bicycle for the mind. Nice work.
