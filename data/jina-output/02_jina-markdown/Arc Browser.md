A browser that doesn’t just meet your needs — it anticipates them.

Clean and calm, Arc shapes itself to how you use the internet.

Space for the different sides of you.

Effortlessly organize everything you do online — work, study, hobbies — all in one window with **Spaces** and **Profiles**.

Your perfect setup.

Find your perfect setup with **Split View**, **Themes**, and more.

The comfort of privacy.

Arc is built from the ground up to be private and secure. We don’t know what sites you visit or what you search for.

I just tried using a computer without Arc and it was miserable.
