Find the answers you need
-------------------------

### What do I need to get started?

Not much! All you need to do is connect AppSheet to your favorite cloud data storage provider, such as Google Drive, Office 365, Dropbox, and Salesforce. Learn more about connecting an initial data source [here](https://about.appsheet.com/how-to-create-an-app/).

### What types of applications can be built with AppSheet?

AppSheet apps work great on both desktop and mobile devices, and are used for a variety of business use cases including project management, operations, field work, human resources, sales, and marketing.

### Does AppSheet really not require any coding?

AppSheet is a true no-code platform, which means anyone can build rich apps and automated processes without writing a line of code. The AppSheet Editor helps make creation easier by automatically generating app prototypes and providing smart suggestions for quick customizations. AppSheet also uses spreadsheet-like expressions to incorporate advanced logic to do things like filter data, create dynamic UI elements, and set up workflow automations.

### What other data sources does AppSheet integrate with?

In addition to Google Sheets and Google Drive, AppSheet apps can connect to hosted Excel files, Cloud SQL, Apigee, Azure SQL, AWS, Salesforce objects, Smartsheet, OData, & more.

### Is AppSheet included in Google Workspace?

Basic applications can be created and shared with small teams in any Workspace account. In order to scale and share apps with larger teams, licenses and an AppSheet subscription is required - AppSheet Core licenses are automatically included in some versions of Workspace Enterprise. [Contact Workspace sales for more information](https://workspace.google.com/contact-form/?source=gafb-pricing-enterprise-en).
