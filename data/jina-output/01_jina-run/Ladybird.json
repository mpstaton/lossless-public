Driven by a web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with good performance, stability and security.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.\n\nLadybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.\n\nWhat makes Ladybird unique\n--------------------------\n\n![Image 4: star symbol](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/truly-independent.svg)\n\n#### Truly independent\n\nNo code from other browsers. We're building a new engine, based on web standards.\n\n![Image 5: target symbol](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/single-focus.svg)\n\n#### Singular focus\n\nWe are focused on one thing: the web browser.\n\n![Image 6: crossed out money symbol](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/no-monetization.svg)\n\n#### No monetization\n\nNo \"default search deals\", crypto tokens, or other forms of user monetization, ever.\n\nNews & Announcements\n--------------------\n\n[Announcement ![Image 7: mike-shaver](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/mike-shaver.jpg) #### Mike Shaver joins the Ladybird Board Bringing in a browser industry veteran to raise the bar.](https://ladybird.org/posts/mike-shaver-joins-board)[Announcement ![Image 8: boardroom](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/boardroom.webp) #### Welcoming Tim Flynn to the Ladybird Board Ensuring that the OSS community has a seat at the table.](https://ladybird.org/posts/tim-flynn-joins-board)[Announcement ![Image 9: plant](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/plant.webp) #### Announcing the Ladybird Browser Initiative Launching our 501(c)(3) nonprofit.](https://ladybird.org/posts/announcement)[Thoughts ![Image 10: katica](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/katica.webp) #### Why we need Ladybird Co-founder Chris Wanstrath shares his thoughts.](https://ladybird.org/posts/why-ladybird)[Announcement ![Image 11: fork](https://ladybird.org/assets/img/fork.webp) #### Ladybird forks from SerenityOS Announcing the split, and what it means for both projects.](https://ladybird.org/posts/fork)\n\nGet Involved\n------------\n\nLadybird is currently in heavy development, and there's work to be done in all areas of the browser.\n\nWe're welcoming new developers every week.

This will be aimed at developers and early adopters.\n\n?\n\nHow many people are working on the browser today?\n\nWe currently have 7 paid full-time engineers working on Ladybird. There is also a large community of volunteer contributors.\n\n?\n\nWhat's the hiring plan?\n\nWe are growing the team at a reasonable pace, as budget allows. Building the right team is more important than building it quickly.  \n  \nWe will strive to maintain 18 months of runway at all times.\n\n?\n\nWhat does \"No code from other browsers\" really mean?\n\nThe focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser engine from the ground up. We don't use code from Blink, WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser engine.  \n  \nFor historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries from the SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of writing _everything_ from scratch. Now that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no longer bound by this culture, and we will be making use of 3rd party libraries for common functionality (e.g image/audio/video formats, encryption, graphics, etc.)  \n  \nWe are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries that other browsers use, but we will never adopt another browser engine instead of building our own.\n\n?\n\nWill Ladybird work on Windows?\n\nWe don't have anyone actively working on Windows support, and there are considerable changes required to make it work well outside a Unix-like environment.  \n  \nWe would like to do Windows eventually, but it's not a priority at the moment.\n\n?\n\nWill Ladybird work on mobile devices?\n\nWe don't have anyone actively working on an Android or iOS port. More effort will be put into mobile once we have the desktop versions in a good state.  \n  \nWhile there is the start of an Android port in the project repository, mobile is not a priority at the moment.\n\n?\n\nWhat are the sponsor tiers?\n\n<table class=\"sponsor-tiers\"><tbody><tr><td>Platinum</td><td>USD $100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>USD $50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>USD $10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>USD $5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Copper</td><td>USD $1,000 (no logo, text only)</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n  \nSponsorships run for one year, then you are welcome to renew.  \n  \nSponsors will have their logos/names displayed on our website, and will be thanked in updates / on social media.  \n  \nPlease [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org) if you are interested in sponsorship.\n\n?\n\nHow can you be \"independent\" if you have sponsors?\n\nAll sponsorships are in the form of unrestricted donations. Board seats and other forms of influence are not for sale.\n\n?\n\nWhy build a new browser in C++ when safer and more modern languages are available?\n\nLadybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++. The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience. Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.  \n  \nHowever, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project, all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect.  \n  \nWe have evaluated a number of alternatives, and will begin incremental adoption of [Swift](https://swift.org/) as a successor language, once Swift version 6 is released.
