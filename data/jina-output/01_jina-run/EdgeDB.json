I'm excited!\n\n![Image 10](https://www.geldata.com/assets/peoplesay/james.jpg)\n\nFirebase Founder\n\nJames Tamplin\n\nThe Gel way\n-----------\n\nWhat does building an app from zero to 1 with Gel look like?\n\nStart a project\n\nA complete database workflow for both local & cloud development. Run Gel CLI with uvx or npx, or install in seconds.\n\nnpx\n\nuvx\n\ncurl\n\nPowershell\n\n$ npx gel project init\n\nMore about the CLI\n\n*   Instant setup: Install Gel CLI in seconds—or use via npx or uvx, with no extra downloads.\n*   Flexible versioning: Run multiple Gel/Postgres versions side by side, no sudo required.\n*   Local & cloud: Create and manage deployments anywhere, from your laptop to the cloud.\n*   Built-in tooling: Apply schema migrations, dump & restore data, open a GUI, or jump into a REPL.\n*   Zero config: Everything just works out of the box—no manual setup needed.\n\nDefine a schema\n\nModel your data with types, not tables. Start with simple types, go nuts with advanced concepts later.\n\nsimple.gel\n\nlvl80.gel\n\nmodule default { type User { name: str; age: int64; multi friends: User; } }\n\nMore about the data model\n\n*   Higher-level modeling: Gel's type-based schema feels natural in modern languages—no ORMs required.\n*   Feature-rich schema: Define object types, abstract types, multiple inheritance and mixins, triggers, annotations, introspection, computed fields, user-defined functions, access policies, and more.\n*   Native performance: Your schema compiles down to efficient, faithful Postgres layouts for speed and reliability.\n*   Built for developers: If traditional databases ever felt like an awkward fit, Gel's flexible design is the solution you've been waiting for.\n\nCreate and apply a migration\n\nIterate on your schema fast. Gel gives you a complete migration system and tools for branching and rapid prototyping.\n\nschema.gel\n\nmigrations/0001.edgeql\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nmodule default {\n  type User {\n    required username: str;\n  }\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nCREATE MIGRATION m1kdtk6ze2irotrxzscsr5hmt55zxv...\n{\n  ALTER TYPE default::User {\n    CREATE REQUIRED PROPERTY email \\-\\> std::str {\n      SET REQUIRED USING ('example@example.com');\n    };\n  };\n};\n\n$ \n\nMore about migrations\n\n*   Purpose-built: Gel was designed for migrations from day one, ensuring a robust, intuitive workflow for any project size.\n*   Framework-agnostic: Learn once, use everywhere—perfect for multi-language or large, distributed teams.\n*   Interactive migrations: The Gel server and CLI work together to provide a guided, user-friendly migration process.\n*   Flexible changes: Squash minor tweaks, add custom steps, and easily browse through existing migration history.\n*   Branch & prototype: Effortlessly experiment with new ideas, then fold them back into your main schema when ready.\n\nGet a client library\n\nFast and robust client libraries. Zero-config, automatic connection pooling, performance-optimized, and auto-recovery from network and transaction errors.\n\nTypescript\n\nPython\n\nGo\n\nDart\n\nRust\n\n.NET\n\nJava\n\nMore about client API's\n\n*   Refined API: Gel client libraries offer a clean, consistent interface across multiple programming languages.\n*   Zero Configuration: No manual setup needed—Gel handles connection pooling and connection options automatically.\n*   Error resilience: Network and transaction issues are handled gracefully with transparent re-connects and retries.\n*   Performance-oriented: Designed for high efficiency under load, minimizing latency and overhead.\n*   Developer-friendly: Minimal boilerplate and clear documentation help teams integrate with ease.\n\nRun a query\n\nComposable, strictly typed, high-performance—pick three. Gel gives you EdgeQL, a type-safe query builder, and classic SQL/ORM options.\n\nmovie.edgeql\n\nmovie.ts\n\nselect Movie { title, actors: { name, } limit 5, rating := math::mean(.reviews.score), } filter <str\\>$actor\\_name in .actors.name\n\nMore about queries\n\n*   EdgeQL: Gel's own fast, readable, composable, graph-relational language—like if SQL and GraphQL had a child, but with superpowers.\n*   TypeScript query builder: A super-flexible builder with unparalleled composability and type safety.\n*   SQL/ORM support: Use standard SQL or plug into your favorite ORM. Gel partnered with Drizzle to create a top-tier JavaScript ORM experience.\n*   Code generation: Generate type-safe code from .edgeql files in the language of your choice—streamlined for any tech stack.\n*   Strict typing: Enjoy type-safe queries that reduce bugs and keep your code robust and maintainable.\n*   GraphQL out of the box: Need even more flexibility? Gel includes native GraphQL support by default.\n\nEnjoy the UI\n\nDon't build an admin panel. Gel comes with a feature rich UI to work with your data & schema, prototype queries, and much more.\n\n![Image 11: Screenshot of query editor showing query result in table format.](https://www.geldata.com/assets/homepage/ui-1.png)![Image 12: Screenshot of query editor for an analyse query, showing visual analyse output.](https://www.geldata.com/assets/homepage/ui-2.png)![Image 13: Screenshot of schema viewer with both text and graph representation of the schema.](https://www.geldata.com/assets/homepage/ui-3.png)![Image 14: Screenshot of data explorer showing drilling down into a row.](https://www.geldata.com/assets/homepage/ui-4.png)![Image 15: Screenshot of query performance statistics UI, showing query execution time histogram.](https://www.geldata.com/assets/homepage/ui-5.png)\n\nMore about Gel UI\n\n*   Comprehensive: Gel's UI has been evolving alongside its core, ensuring a reliable and fully-featured tool.\n*   Key features: Schema browser, data editor, query IDE, visual query builder, web-REPL, query performance visualization, and AI/Auth configuration.\n*   Universal access: Run locally or in the cloud, on desktop browsers or mobile devices—no separate setup required.\n\nEnable AI\n\nAutomatic embeddings creation and RAG. With just a few lines in your schema Gel will talk to LLMs give you a ready to go RAG endpoint.\n\nsimple.gel\n\nusing extension ai;\n\nPick an LLM or configure a custom one.\n\nMore about Gel AI\n\n*   Seamless opt-in: Enable AI when you're ready—no hidden defaults or dependencies.\n*   Schema-driven embeddings: Simply annotate your data, and Gel handles embedding creation, storage, and indexing behind the scenes.\n*   Built-in RAG: Enjoy a native Retrieval Augmented Generation endpoint for instant AI-driven insights, complete with an admin UI for rapid testing.\n*   Flexible providers: Connect Gel AI to your preferred LLM service, so you can choose the best fit for your use case.\n*   Scalable & integrated: Combine your AI features with Gel's powerful type system and migrations to build robust, future-proof data solutions.\n\nEnable Auth\n\nAuth is a solved problem.

More is better.\n\nDavid Cramer, Sentry, Founder\n\nThe most high tech companies in the world run graph architectures on top of SQL. Now you, too, can be high tech.\n\nTheo, t3.gg\n\nAs a long time hater of MongoDB, I'm pumped to see a real challenger for SQL that goes the other direction. Relations are good!\n\nSebastián Ramírez, FastAPI\n\nIf you want to use a relational database but you wish there was something beyond SQL, you should check out Gel. As it generates strict types, has async drivers, and has great performance, it's a great DB option for FastAPI apps. And it's built by the same people that created the async Python underpinnings that enable things like FastAPI.\n\nCharlie Marsh, Astral, Founder\n\nI've been continually impressed by both the ideas behind Gel and the way they've been brought to life.\n\n[Cloud Sign Up](https://cloud.geldata.com/)[Getting Started](https://www.geldata.com/p/quickstart-docs)\n\nProduct\n\n[Home](https://www.geldata.com/)[Cloud](https://www.geldata.com/cloud)[Pricing](https://www.geldata.com/pricing)[Cloud Status](https://www.gelstatus.com/)\n\nResources\n\n[Quickstart](https://www.geldata.com/p/quickstart-docs)[Documentation](https://docs.geldata.com/)[Community Discord](https://discord.gg/gel)\n\nCompany\n\n[About](https://www.geldata.com/about)[Terms of Use](https://www.geldata.com/terms-of-use)[Privacy Policy](https://www.geldata.com/privacy-policy)[Cloud Terms and Conditions](https://www.geldata.com/cloud-terms-and-conditions)\n\nNewsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list to be the first to know about new blog posts and announcements.\n\n[RSS](https://www.geldata.com/rss.xml)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/geldata)[](https://github.com/geldata)[](https://discord.gg/gel)[](https://youtube.com/@EdgeDB)© 2025, Gel Data Inc.  \n(Formerly EdgeDB Inc.)",
