Then you’ve likely encountered these headaches\n\nWorking **with over-complicated observability platforms** that don't understand your code or application.\n\nSifting through **endless print statements** and decoding cryptic portrayals of Python objects in your logs.\n\n**Guessing at the performance hit** from a specific function, or a mysterious slowdown of your app.\n\nWhether you’re building an AI tool or any other cloud-based app, these frustrating scenarios are avoidable but all too real.\n\nINTRODUCING LOGFIRE\n\nA more intuitive way to understand your\n\nLLM\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPydantic Logfire is a window into the inner workings of your application. Smooth to set up and easy to understand, with ready integrations for many popular libraries.\n\n![Image 1](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/tabbed-code-blocks/openai/icon.svg)\n\nOpenAI\n\n![Image 2](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/tabbed-code-blocks/fastapi/icon.svg)\n\nFastAPI\n\n![Image 3](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/tabbed-code-blocks/database/icon.svg)\n\nDatabase\n\n![Image 4](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=1080,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/tabbed-code-blocks/openai/left-code-block.svg)\n\nexpand\n\n[see in full](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-demo)\n\n![Image 5](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=1920,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/tabbed-code-blocks/openai/right-code-block.png)\n\n[view full example](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-demo)\n\nFeatures\n\nPython and beyond\n\nWhile Pydantic Logfire is Python-first, it’s an observability platform that works just as well with other programming languages.\n\nPerformance insights\n\nTransform garbled logs into actionable insights. Discover not just how long a function takes to run, but which queries slow down your app.\n\nComprehensive visibility\n\nUnderstand your app’s behaviour — from request headers and bodies to the full trace of program execution.\n\nData-driven decisions\n\nTurn your logs into visualizations, dashboards, and alerts that drive development forward.\n\nInsights\n\n### Faster fixes, deeper insights\n\nWith an SDK built on top of OpenTelemetry, structured data and an intuitive interface, Pydantic Logfire makes it easy to monitor the behavior of Python applications, at every level. Instrument your app using best practices and draw powerful insights — without hiring a dedicated analytics or observability team.\n\nStructured Data & Direct SQL Access\n-----------------------------------\n\nEnsure your Python objects and structured data are query-ready. Use tools like Pandas, SQLAlchemy, or psql for querying, integrate seamlessly with BI software, and leverage AI for SQL generation.\n\n```\nSELECT\n  attributes->>'campaign' as campaign,\n  count(distinct attributes->>'track_id') as clicks,\n  round(count(distinct attributes->>'track_id')::numeric/50*100, 2) as click_rate\nFROM records\nWHERE\n  span_name = 'Click on {campaign}' and\n  attributes->>'campaign' ilike 'c%'\nGROUP BY attributes->>'campaign'\n```\n\nManual Tracing\n--------------\n\nYou can use the logfire library to create logs and traces directly — it’s kind of like standard logging in Python, with a more modern interface and some extra capabilities. And a lot less painful than using OpenTelemetry directly.\n\n[learn more](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/onboarding_checklist/add_manual_tracing/)\n\n```\nimport logfire\n\nlogfire.configure()\n\nname = 'world'\nlogfire.info(f'Hello, {name}!')\n# ^ Equivalent to:\n# logfire.info('Hello, {name}!', name=name)\n\nadvantages = 'timing', 'context', 'exception capturing'\nwith logfire.span(f'spans provide: {advantages}'):\n     logfire.warn('the next line will raise an exception')\n     1 / 0\n```\n\nOpenTelemetry\n-------------\n\n[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) (OTel) is an open source observability framework, it provides libraries for Python and every other popular language to let you collect traces, logs and metrics.\n\nOTel is a powerful tool that increasing numbers of developers want to use, but it can be time-consuming to set up and limited in the kinds of data it can collect.\n\nPydantic Logfire takes the best of OTel (instrumentation for popular Python packages, open standard for data transmission) and makes it easier to use and more flexible.\n\nBy harnessing OpenTelemetry, Pydantic Logfire offers automatic instrumentation for popular Python packages, enables cross-language data integration, and supports data export to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend or proxy.\n\nLogfire is already making developers' lives easier\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's just that amazingly simple and helpful. Logfire will change the way Python people do application level observability for sure.\n\nFlorian Kromer\n\nLogfire is a fantastic tool for us; all developers should use it. We have a small dev team and Logfire has already led to us catching and solving issues in a way we couldn't before. The easy integration with Django and our other Python services made implementation very simple; our junior developers love it.\n\nTom Hamilton Stubber\n\nLogfire was super easy to setup, but gave us superpowers in terms of the insights we got instantly for our API. Combining logs, profiling and telemetry all in one. Seriously, it's just what we needed and really love it.\n\nBirk Jernström\n\nLogfire is the observability platform built by the stellar team behind Pydantic, if you use FastAPI or Pydantic in general, you should definitely check it out!\n\nSebastián Ramírez\n\nIt was extremely easy! It took all of 10 minutes to get it running in our test suite and local dev env.\n\nPeter Hoburg\n\nI’m blown away by Logfire. It’s the observability and monitoring tooling of my dreams.

Whether you’re using observability for the first time or an expert, we make it easy.\n\nOut-of-the-box integration\n\nUse Pydantic Logfire to monitor the data that runs through Pydantic for a customized experience that goes way beyond generic observability platforms.\n\nFOR DEVELOPERS\n\nReady to start building?\n\nLogfire’s Python SDK is open source under the MIT license and wraps the OpenTelemetry Python package. By default, it will send data to the Logfire platform but you could send data to any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) compliant endpoint.\n\n[Docs Docs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs)\n\n[GitHub GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire)\n\n[Slack Slack](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/help/#slack)\n\n### A window into your application\n\n[Get started Get started](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/)pip install logfire\n\nFooter(\n\n['/logfire'](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)['/pricing'](https://pydantic.dev/pricing)['/articles'](https://pydantic.dev/articles)['/about'](https://pydantic.dev/about)['/opensource'](https://pydantic.dev/opensource)['/contact'](https://pydantic.dev/contact)['/privacy'](https://pydantic.dev/legal/privacy-policy)['/terms'](https://pydantic.dev/legal/terms-of-service)['/cookies'](https://pydantic.dev/legal/privacy-policy#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)\n\nfoo=\\[\n\n['/logfire',](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)['/pricing',](https://pydantic.dev/pricing)['/articles'](https://pydantic.dev/articles)\n\n\\],\n\nbar=\\[\n\n['/about',](https://pydantic.dev/about)['/opensource',](https://pydantic.dev/opensource)['/contact'](https://pydantic.dev/contact)\n\n\\],\n\nspam=\\[\n\n['/privacy',](https://pydantic.dev/legal/privacy-policy)['/terms',](https://pydantic.dev/legal/terms-of-service)['/cookies'](https://pydantic.dev/legal/privacy-policy#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)\n\n\\],\n\n)\n\n[](https://pydantic.dev/)",
