A replacement for the essay... has the potential to be as profound a mental prosthetic as hypertext.\n\nSarah Constantin\n\nExecutive Director, The Longevity Research Institute\n\nThe thing that's delighted me most about Roam has been how having it open in a tab affects my entire attitude about research. I feel like I'm playing learning: the video game.\n\nChelsea Voss\n\nMember of Technical Staff, OpenAI\n\nRoam has enabled me to stop segmenting and limiting my thoughts before I’ve even fleshed them out. This flexibility has freed me up to write 3x more daily content than ever before.\n\nMansi Jain\n\nStanford, Class of 2019\n\nRoam is the productivity tool that I didn't know I needed. It helps me organize thoughts and reduce the clutter in my head, something no productivity or organization tool has ever offered me before.\n\nSam Davis\n\nResearcher, Stanford University Department of Applied Physics\n\nIt took me 36 years and a dozen failed \"systems\" in different apps to figure out that knowledge is organized associatively, not hierarchically. Breakthroughs: bullet journal in Workflowy, then wiki in Bear, now daily auto-back-linked-wiki interconnected brain dumps in Roam.\n\nMarcin Ignac\n\nFounder, Variable.io\n\nRoam is amazing, note-writing on a totally new level - frictionless yet cohesive in a way that Evernote hasn't quite reached for me.\n\nHuan Win\n\nProject Engineer, Halleck-Willard\n\n### Trusted by Writers|\n\nfrom organizations including\n\nDeepMind\n\nFacebook\n\nDropbox\n\nGatsby\n\nThe Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative\n\nStanford University\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n### Pro\n\n$15\n\n/ month\n\n$180 / year\n\n$165\n\n/ year\n\n$13.75 / month\n\n**+**\n\nUnlimited Private or Public Roam Graphs\n\nUnlimited Collaborators\n\nAPI access and Apps_Coming Soon_\n\nStart Free Trial \\*\n\nYou'll be charged after 31 days\n\n\\* Trial only valid if you've never had a plan\n\n### Believer\n\n$500\n\n/ 5 years\n\n$8.33 / month, $100 / year\n\nEverything in Pro Plan plus...\n\nFirst Access to New Features\n\nCommunity Calls with the Team\n\nPriority Support\n\nJoin\n\nYou'll be charged $500 today\n\n#### About\n\nWe believe that writing is a tool for thinking. If we can build a tool for helping people write and organize their ideas more effectively, we can help them have better thoughts and solve otherwise intractable problems.\n\n[T&C](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/MHRK1dgTE)/[Privacy](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/bnQcAUM0i)\n\n#### Learn\n\n[White Paper](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6)\n\n[Demo Videos](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/2h9V-FtAO)\n\n[Articles About Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/cGQjOo9hq)\n\n#### Connect\n\nSupport\n\n[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/roamresearch/shared_invite/zt-2ukldw4mq-vkF95tb~0zbzkJ38nzZ6uA)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)\n\n![Image 6](https://roamresearch.com/assets/astrolabe-white.png)\n\nRoam RESEARCH",
