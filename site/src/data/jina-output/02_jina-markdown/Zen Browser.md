Productivity at its best

Zen is packed with features that help you stay productive and focused. Browsers should be tools that help you get things done, not distractions that keep you from your work.

Workspaces

Organize your tabs into workspaces to keep your projects separate and organized, and switch between them with ease.

Compact Mode

Zen's compact mode gives you more screen real estate by hiding the tab bar when you don't need it, and showing it when you do.

Glance

Zen's glance feature lets you preview tabs without switching to them, so you can quickly find the tab you're looking for.

Split View

Zen's split view feature lets you view two tabs side by side, so you can compare information or work on two things at once.

Our Core Values

We make it not only a priority, but a necessity to ensure that Zen always provides the best experience for you. We are committed to making Zen the most beautiful, productive, and privacy-focused browser out there.

Simple yet powerful

True privacy and always up-to-date
