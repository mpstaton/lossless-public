![Image 43](blob:https://mattermost.com/7af094281f2122c2b89c0a0956c2f8c4)

#### Adaptable

Integrate and extend your collaboration environment to fit the tools you need to achieve the mission, from custom apps to industry standards.

![Image 45](blob:https://mattermost.com/be0b5eec1a06b8282d8b1981242ae01d)

#### Focused

With deep integrations with mission-critical tools, integrated playbooks and native audio calling, Mattermost cuts through the noise to keep your team focused on the workflows that matter most.

![Image 47](blob:https://mattermost.com/8225db1c7f01c809a978ccada74f8246)

#### Secure

When you secure your data, you secure your mission. Robust security and compliance features ensure your data stays controlled and secure at all times.

![Image 49](blob:https://mattermost.com/0b2e86aa55a533e12d2e774cc47d47b3)

#### Resilient

When incidents happen, effective recovery is critical to mission success. Support for self-hosted, private cloud and high-availability deployments give you control even in highly sensitive environments.
