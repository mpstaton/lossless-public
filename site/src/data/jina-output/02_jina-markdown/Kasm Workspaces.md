Enterprise Zero Trust Web Access

![Image 60](https://kasmweb.com/assets/images/homeSolution_5.webp)

#### Browser Isolation

A remote, containerized browser that is rendered inside the user’s local browser serving as a secure intermediary that tightly controls what data is allowed to be brought into our allowed out of the network. This is the ultimate protection from viruses, ransomware, and other types of malware complimented by absolute control of data loss prevention.

#### Enterprise Web Gateway

Move the risk of web threats outside of your organization with our transparent web redirects. Your users will feel as if they are experiencing the web firsthand, however, since web content never directly interacts with the user’s endpoint, your enterprise is protected against malware and your data remains safe.

#### Kasm Cloud Browser

Our Zero-Trust Browser Isolation SaaS. Keep your web browsing secure, private, and non-attributable with no risk of compromising your endpoint. A fully-patched, disposable browser that is destroyed after each use, eliminating all traces of malware, tracking cookies, browser history, browser caching, and session fingerprints.

![Image 70](https://kasmweb.com/assets/images/homeSolution_8.webp)

#### Enterprise Zero Trust Web Access

One of the biggest security risks to organizations is direct internet access to the endpoint. Employees typically need access to the internet to do their jobs, but the proliferation of viruses, malware and phishing attacks pose a significant risk. Browser Isolation categorically removes this risk, by shifting the paradigm of how this internet is accessed.
