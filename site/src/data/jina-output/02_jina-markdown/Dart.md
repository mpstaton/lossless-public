I really enjoy using the app - it has replaced my other kanban apps because of the AI features. Auto fill properties and generate subtasks are a massive boon. I look forward to using Dart more!

Sijia Qiu

Analytics Consultant

I've tried dozens of task management apps, and Dart is by far my favorite. You can run every feature via keyboard shortcuts, deeply customize your layout, and easily separate work and personal tasks.

‍

We use Dart for both team and personal tasks, and it ties with Slack as our most-frequently used app.

David Paffenholz

CEO & Co-Founder

Dart's made it really easy to organize and manage tasks while capturing context.

It's naturally integrated into our workflows and has really helped with productivity. We used to use iNotes/OneNote but Dart’s speed, shortcuts, and intuitive flow had us using it daily within a week of onboarding.

CEO & Cofounder

I've witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of Dart's task management tool on our organization. Its integration of generative AI has been a game-changer, significantly boosting my team's productivity by streamlining administrative tasks.

Dart's continuous evolution excites me, and I highly recommend it to any organization seeking to minimize administrative overhead while maintaining detailed task tracking, including durations, dependencies, and resource allocation.

Dart has been an impressive project management tool, offering a seamless and beautiful experience that fits perfectly for various needs. Its user-friendly design and efficient document handling make it a pleasure to use, prompting me to transition all my work onto it.

Dart is 10x faster and cleaner than any other way we've found to track our work. Dart has been super quick-to-setup and incredibly fast for us to use. Other task managers had too much of overhead.

Craig Bonnoit

THANK YOU!!! The chatgpt integration is amazing. I gave it enough context and prompting that it generated for me the exact daily plan for the next 90 days of building my startup MVP (with scary accuracy), and then Dart just created all the tasks for me. Thank you for this amazing and time saving capability.

‍

This just saved me probably an entire weeks worth of headache and trying to get my self organized let alone actually get the work done.

Ahmad Taleb

Product Manager

I’ve tried many other project management platforms and have always been frustrated by the overhead that comes with even the simplest of actions. With Dart though, creating, organizing, and planning tasks takes me a fraction of the time, especially with Dart’s easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts. The AI tools are also really powerful, and Dart keeps adding more and more capability there. Excited to see this keep growing!

Luke Asperger

Engineering Manager

Dart has changed the way I plan my work. With nearly 15 years of work in the Human Resources field, project management and prioritization is routinely the area that HR teams struggle with most.

‍

Dart AI is the springboard I never knew I needed. The built-in AI capabilities make organizing projects, prioritizing work, and establishing robust documentation practices more manageable and allow for immense creativity. I'm able to collaborate with co-workers in ways not possible without the AI automation tools Dart provides. I'd recommend Dart to anyone needing help with their professional and personal project management needs.

Blake Hudson

HR Manager

Dart is amazing! It’s much simpler and easier to use than other PM tools. The load time is impressively fast, and the keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity a lot. The UX is perfectly balanced, utilizing space and typography effectively to display the right amount of information on each page. Dart is a joy to use compared to other tools I’ve dreaded

I've been using Dart for months now, and it is my #1 tool for managing my projects! Plus, the user experience is crisp and it's a pleasure to make, track, and then close out tasks :)

I really enjoy using the app - it has replaced my other kanban apps because of the AI features. Auto fill properties and generate subtasks are a massive boon. I look forward to using Dart more!

I've tried dozens of task management apps, and Dart is by far my favorite. You can run every feature via keyboard shortcuts, deeply customize your layout, and easily separate work and personal tasks.

‍

We use Dart for both team and personal tasks, and it ties with Slack as our most-frequently used app.

Dart's made it really easy to organize and manage tasks while capturing context.

It's naturally integrated into our workflows and has really helped with productivity. We used to use iNotes/OneNote but Dart’s speed, shortcuts, and intuitive flow had us using it daily within a week of onboarding.

I've witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of Dart's task management tool on our organization. Its integration of generative AI has been a game-changer, significantly boosting my team's productivity by streamlining administrative tasks.

Dart's continuous evolution excites me, and I highly recommend it to any organization seeking to minimize administrative overhead while maintaining detailed task tracking, including durations, dependencies, and resource allocation.

Dart is 10x faster and cleaner than any other way we've found to track our work. Dart has been super quick-to-setup and incredibly fast for us to use. Other task managers had too much of overhead.

THANK YOU!!! The chatgpt integration is amazing. I gave it enough context and prompting that it generated for me the exact daily plan for the next 90 days of building my startup MVP (with scary accuracy), and then Dart just created all the tasks for me. Thank you for this amazing and time saving capability.

‍

This just saved me probably an entire weeks worth of headache and trying to get my self organized let alone actually get the work done.

Ahmad Taleb

Product Manager

I’ve tried many other project management platforms and have always been frustrated by the overhead that comes with even the simplest of actions. With Dart though, creating, organizing, and planning tasks takes me a fraction of the time, especially with Dart’s easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts. The AI tools are also really powerful, and Dart keeps adding more and more capability there. Excited to see this keep growing!

Luke Asperger

Engineering Manager

Dart has changed the way I plan my work. With nearly 15 years of work in the Human Resources field, project management and prioritization is routinely the area that HR teams struggle with most.

‍

Dart AI is the springboard I never knew I needed. The built-in AI capabilities make organizing projects, prioritizing work, and establishing robust documentation practices more manageable and allow for immense creativity. I'm able to collaborate with co-workers in ways not possible without the AI automation tools Dart provides. I'd recommend Dart to anyone needing help with their professional and personal project management needs.

Blake Hudson

HR Manager

Dart is amazing! It’s much simpler and easier to use than other PM tools. The load time is impressively fast, and the keyboard shortcuts enhance productivity a lot. The UX is perfectly balanced, utilizing space and typography effectively to display the right amount of information on each page. Dart is a joy to use compared to other tools I’ve dreaded
