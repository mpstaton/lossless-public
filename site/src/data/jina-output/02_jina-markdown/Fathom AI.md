##### "Game changer for my coaching biz"

One of the things I love most about Fathom is how quickly it returns transcriptions. It's fantastic to be able to see everything that was said in a meeting or conversation in real-time.

##### "Reliable Software and Team - Allows me to be present in meetings and follow-up quickly"

Our biggest win is that our team can be PRESENT during the call rather than scrambling to write down the major issues or points to follow up on.

##### "Above and Beyond Notes"

I was using one of their competitors when I was introduced to Fathom, and I can honestly say I was blown away by the level of detail and accuracy Fathom provides for my meetings. From the automatic screenshots to, as I said, the accuracy of the notes. I also appreciate the way it summarizes the discussions and knows who is speaking. Simply fantastic.

I LOVE that you can send the whole recording of the meeting, or just send specific clips of the meeting to people. Brilliant.

##### "Fathom is a no brainer and their GTM is genius..."

It just works. Super easy to understand, valuable connections to other tech (i.e. AI summary in a format for the output e.g. Google Docs) Highlights are just done right and valuable for making the points that matter in a call.

Fathom is a great tool which has almost eliminated the need to take rushed notes during our calls and, as it's currently free, it's a no-brainer decision if you are a regular Zoom user.

##### "Game changer for Zoom meetings"

My favorite feature is the AI summary of the conversation, which has a simple button to copy and I can then paste into my CRM.

##### "Call notes that actually work!"

It generates thoughtful discussion on how I can improve, the different angles I can take with prospects to show value, and helps him understand what our customers are facing in a way that really sinks in.

##### "Fathom will change the way you run meetings!"

Fathom let's you focus on the meeting content rather than focusing on taking notes. With Fathom I can now be fully engaged in the conversation and know I am not missing anything. I love how it records the video and transcribes the meeting as well. The best feature is the ability to tag points of relevance in the meeting to revisit later. Best business tool I've found all year!

I've used Fathom in every single Zoom meeting I've had with a client, about 8 per week, which has allowed me to streamline our sales process, shorten turnaround time, and take over as the head of sales in my organization.

##### "Game changer for Zoom meetings"

My favorite feature is the AI summary of the conversation, which has a simple button to copy and I can then paste into my CRM.

##### "Call notes that actually work!"

It generates thoughtful discussion on how I can improve, the different angles I can take with prospects to show value, and helps him understand what our customers are facing in a way that really sinks in.

##### "Fathom will change the way you run meetings!"

Fathom let's you focus on the meeting content rather than focusing on taking notes. With Fathom I can now be fully engaged in the conversation and know I am not missing anything. I love how it records the video and transcribes the meeting as well. The best feature is the ability to tag points of relevance in the meeting to revisit later. Best business tool I've found all year!

Fathom is so easy to use and implement, I like that I can focus on my meetings attendees and not have to get flustered with meeting notes.

Fathom makes re-visiting notes and key points from zoom conversations effortless.

##### "Being PRESENT in a meeting while not missing anything important is PRICELESS"

Fathom has been a game changer for my customer calls. I have a hard time truly focusing on a conversation while taking notes. Fathom has given me the ability to be PRESENT in my meeting with clients. I can listen with empathy and not worry about missing any important details.

##### "New favorite business tool!"

I think the highlights are my favorite feature. There are so many things I love about it, but that's what I tell folks about first. Oh‚Äîthat, and being able to paste easily into various formats. It's made working from transcripts a breeze.

##### "Best AI Notetaker"

I love functionality of highlight & action and ability of the app to rewind the conversation. AI summary is also great, really summarize the gist of the conversation without any distortions or made-up additions.

##### "The Best Tool for Meetings!"

I love that I can always go back and rewatch any meetings, as well as having the transcriptions of them! I use Fathom for every single meeting, which is about 7-8 times a week so it helps me keep them all organized. It was super easy to set up my account and integrate it with my google meet account aswell!

##### "Number one tool I use as as CSM; have recommended to all of my colleagues"

Love being able to select a category for the type of feedback I'm receiving, and creating a shareable "snippet" of that segment of the call, that I can easily give to Product if it's product feedback, or to another member of the team if it's a technical question, etc.

##### "Fathom made me switch all video calls to Zoom"

There's so much I love about Fathom: the instant availability to the recordings, the searchable transcripts, the call summaries, the ability to mark highights and tasks during the calls. It made me switch all of my video calls from Teams to Zoom.

##### "Fathom Saves CSM Time"

I love that the Fathom notetaker automatically starts with all my customer facing meetings. It makes it so I don't have to worry about remembering to record meetings. The new AI summaries are AMAZING and I cannot say enough good things. It is saving me 30-40 mintues per meeting summary.

##### "Fathom Makes Meetings Fun and Easy: No More Worrying About Notes!"

One of the standout attributes of Fathom, and a feature that I hold in high esteem, is its ability to alleviate the stress of taking notes during meetings. It's a game-changer, truly. Gone are the days when active participation was marred by the constant necessity to jot down crucial points.

##### "I absolutely love the Fathom platform."

I am new but this zoom add-on is incredible. soon as my zoom meeting was over I had a summary I was able to email it to all attendees in seconds!. Plus the transcript was ready and I could forward or send link all right from the one screen, no hunting around etc. Fathom really gets moving at the speed of business.

##### "Fabulous idea, excellent execution"

Being an avid notetaker, I love that I am not missing anything and can go back and read it ALL in the transcript. I'm delighted with how much more present I can be and not worry about getting all the information I need. Fathom is a double timesaver!

##### "My meetings are so much more efficient!"

My favorite thing about Fathom is the ability to quick-add "to do" items during my meeting. During a strategy session with a client, I often come across things that I need to do, or things that the account manager or client need to do. Using the customized options for quickly noting these parts of the meeting - with just a single click - has been SO helpful! I no longer have to switch to a different view to make note of the action item.

##### "Seamless, Effortless, and Extremely Convenient"

Fathom allows me to concentrate on HOW people communicate and less on WHAT people communicate. As a performance coach this is vital. I can always go back and check the video/transcript/summary to get into the details. The integration with zoom is easy to use. The custom buttons to mark sections and highlight convos are easy and convinient. I think the best part for me is the monolog meter. This tells me if I'm talking too much. It is like Fathos was built for my needs.

It does a killer job of recording and transcribing calls, and the new AI summary feature is brilliant. I can take the summary and send it as a recap with minimal tweaks saving me time. I also like how it breaks out the questions by person asked during the meeting - I can click on those questions, and it takes me to the portion of the conversation where it originated. I have recommended it to countless people.

##### "The Best AI Assistant for Your Meetings"

Fathom does so much more than just transcribe your meetings. It has a control panel that you can view like a sidebar during your meetings, so you can tell it that you want to "highlight" what you are talking about or mark it as an "action item". With these options, you truely don't have to worry about taking notes and you can focus on the conversation.

##### "Fathom has transformed how we work"

Fathom is amazing for not only capturing the video of a meeting but also the transcription. The most valuable part of Fathom for us is the ability to look through the transcription, locate an area of the meeting we want to review, click on that transcription and the video automatically goes to that location to be played. This has been a game changer not only for us but, for our clients as well. We have started to send links to the videos to our clients and they love it.

Fathom is powerful but simple. It's clear they're very product-minded - everything just works smoothly. I used to deal with all kinds of complicated ways to save and share notes from calls. But Fathom is a 1-stop shop.

##### "Once you Fathom, you can never go back"

I like having notes of my meetings. Fathom does that and so much more. I love the ability to highlight and bookmark parts of the conversations while they are happening. The little summaries of these snippets are super helpful.

##### "Fathom has transformed how we work"

Fathom is amazing for not only capturing the video of a meeting but also the transcription. The most valuable part of Fathom for us is the ability to look through the transcription, locate an area of the meeting we want to review, click on that transcription and the video automatically goes to that location to be played. This has been a game changer not only for us but, for our clients as well. We have started to send links to the videos to our clients and they love it.

##### "My zooms just got 10x better"

Fathom is a wonderful tool, it's been incredibly handy. First of all, the notification that pops up for meetings has helped me improve my on-time meeting attendance greatly. The automatic recording feature is great, and super easy to dismiss when not needed.

##### "Changed my life"

Fathom has saved me so much time after calls when I would have to go through pages of notes from the call. It also allows me to be much more present and listening on the call. I am now using it every day on every call internally and externally. Love it.

##### "Must Have - Don't do any meeting without it"

The intersection between video, auto-generated notes and auto-generated insights - I can pause, rewind, listen, read or follow up faster and more accurately after any meeting. Also if someone was not able to join then sharing its super easy.

##### "As a Virtual Assistant, Fathom helps me stay organized!"

I no longer have to take notes during my intake calls because Fathom successfully records my zoom meetings, sends me the recording afire I end the meeting, and accurately transcribes each meeting for me. And the best part is that it's free! I love Fathom!

##### "First time Fathomer"

All the automatic features. It preps to start recording when I sign into a call. I offers to send the recording to the attendees when I'm done. It prepares a link to share with team members that weren't on the call. The transcripts are accurate. The time stamps and section breakdowns are in all the right places. I mean, c'mon man!

Fathom CHANGED MY LIFE! As a VA I am always taking copious notes from each meeting, I can now focus on the discussion and know that everything has been transcribed accurately. The tagging function is amazing, Action Items, no problem, just tag it! All attendees get the transcription, so there is no misunderstanding of any minutes of meetings. I recommend that you install Fathom right now!

I always liked the meeting transcript aspect, but now the AI summaries are amazing me!

It has shaved so much time off for me post meetings in creating meeting minutes and action items.

The tagging function is amazing, Action Items, no problem, just tag it! All attendees get the transcription, so there is no misunderstanding of any minutes of meetings. I recommend that you install Fathom right now!

##### "Awesome tool that I now cannot live without."

The in-call note-taking capability caused us to rewrite our meeting policies... the ability to customize the note types, and highlight recordings is great. What may be the best feature of all is the search functionality that reads all transcripts. VERY ROBUST!

##### "Best Assistant Out There!"

I am in about 25 to 30 hours of meetings a week and this by far has changed the way on how I do meetings and take notes. This has been a godsend and has streamlined my work by 75%.

##### "What's not to like"

I always liked the meeting transcript aspect, but now the AI summaries are amazing me! It catches all the conversation correctly, even with sound issues, etc, even when the meeting participants are all over the place during their conversation. It has shaved so much time off for me post meetings in creating meeting minutes and action items.

##### "How did I live without this?"

I can't tell you how much time this software saves me. The AI summary of the meeting is genius. I click on Action Items either during the meeting, or after (with the transcript or recording), load those into Asana, and done!

With Fathom, I am able to concentrate on what is happening in the Zoom meeting and not typing or handwriting notes. I simply launch Fathom and let it take the notes for me.

##### "No Conversion Time... Can Send Links To Clients Immediately!"

I've been using Fathom for quite some time now. I no longer have to worry about the recordings. They are accessible immediately upon completion of the Zoom call. The main benefit of Fathom for me is to keep Zoom recordings and transcripts in the same area. I love that I can send the call recording immediately to participants. I also like that it identifies the speakers by name automatically.

##### "I am a Fathom fan!"

The most helpful feature Fathom offers is the dialogue tracker. When I am taking notes and miss something, I know that Fathom caught it and can go back and see what was said. I also really like the saving/sending options. It is so easy to navigate the platform and I have always had wonderful customer service experiences with the team at Fathom. It's a great platform and I am so thrilled with how helpful it is to me when notetaking during meetings or webinars.

##### "More than just recording a call/meeting"

Fathom really has gone beyond the basics. They not only automatically record your Zoom calls, but they also provide you with a tool that allows you to flag moments within the call stand out. This can be things such as insights and feedback given by members of the call, or even better... Action Items that need to be noted during the call. Then, when the call is over, it automatically opens up the recording of the call for you, along with anything you flagged, notes, transcript, etc. It's a well-thought-out tool.

##### "Fathom has become a beloved tool our team uses every day where we can share calls and highlights!"

The main benefit of Fathom for me is the ability to have a shared library of team calls, and I love highlights with Slack. The seamless integrations with zoom mean that it has been on every call and we never miss a recording to forgetting to hit the record button or joining a call we don't host. Support & Customer Success teams are absolute legends!

##### "Game changer for meetings"

Reduces the number of people we need to have at meetings. Before, we'd have people there who only needed the FYI. Now they can use the highlights/question list/transcript/video watched on 2x to get all the info they need without having to sit through a 60 minute meeting.

##### "Fathom - A must have in the increasing online work environment"

Honestly I love that while using fathom I can focus on the meeting, interacting with the individual, and understanding on a deeper level than having to take notes.

With Fathom, I've stopped taking notes on Zoom calls. Instead, I stay engaged in conversation and don't worry about missing an important point or detail.

##### "Fast, reliable, huge time & effort saver"

It's simple to record Zoom meetings, and unlike with Zoom where you can only record video, and it takes a while to come through, Fathom records a video and takes a full transcript (which is searchable), shown by speaker, and provides a summary of the meeting

##### "Fathom is a GAME CHANGER for our digital marketing agency team!"

The standout feature of Fathom is its accurate and reliable transcription functionality.

This eliminates the need for manual note-taking, allowing participants to fully engage in the conversation without the worry of missing important details.

##### "The best meeting tool since Google Docs"

Fathom's AI transcript is pretty close to perfect, I can share the summaries with the team and easily go back in any meeting and scan until I find what I need. It has saved me hours of time and it shows in how many other more important things I am able to do during the day.

Having the action items and highlights marked with just one click and getting a precise time stamp, description, and recap for the. And being able to copy it to other platforms easily. Also, for the meetings on my calendar, Fathom will come 5 mins before with a "Join Meeting" button, helping me make sure Fathoms is in on time for the meetings.

Plus it's super easy to integrate and connect to my calendar as well.

##### "Game changer for me"

I've been using Fathom for a few weeks now, and appreciate how it allows me to be more present in meetings instead of transcribing my own notes. The live appending features (highlights, bookmarks, to-dos) in Fathom help me ensure that I pay particular attention to the most relevant parts of the conversation in my review.

##### "A Game-Changer"

Meetings used to be a double-edged sword for us. While they were great for collaboration, the aftermath was often a scramble to remember what was discussed. Enter Fathom. It's not just another tool; it's been a real ally. It discreetly joins in, records, and then hands us these neat summaries. It's like having an extra team member who's just there to help us keep track.

##### "Best app in zoom hands down üèÜ"

It's such an amazing backup as I forgot to hit record on a podcast on Zoom and fathom was recording and the video was actually better than the Zoom video. What a lifesaver. Best tool ever for time, backup and note taking!

##### "Must have for anyone on a lot of video calls"

One of the most frictionless note-taking apps I've ever used. If you're taking notes on a call, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Fathom does a spectacular job of providing clear action items and hits that rare SaaS user experience where I forget I'm even using a tool.

Fathom makes business communication and meetings easier, period. As an avid fan and long-time Otter.ai user, I couldn't believe there was anything better. Until a friend told me about Fathom. I was skeptical and waited months to use it. She was right. Fathom has far better features and a streamlined UI/UX that's on point.

##### "For Zoom meetings, consider Fathom a godsend ... or at least your very attentive employee."

Fathom launches automatically for each and every Zoom call. There is no need to remember to turn it on or launch it. Start your Zoom meeting and there is ... showing up barely seconds after you start your meeting. It listens attentively and captures every single word whilst correctly attributing it to the right person who spoke. Within a minute or two after your meeting ends, your entire transcript is sitting there in the cloud.

##### "Excellent tool and huge timesaver"

Their AI summaries are shockingly good. They make sending meeting recaps and assigning action items a breeze. Another great feature is their direct integration with Hubspot. It will automatically tie the recording, highlights and summary directly to the company and contact card of the attendees.

#### What does Fathom cost?

Fathom is 100% free for unlimited recording, transcription, and summarization. We offer a Premium version of Fathom that includes advanced AI features like AI-generated action items and 12 different meeting summary templates. We also offer [Fathom Team Edition](https://fathom.video/for/teams) that is designed to provide additional features for teams and managers that use Fathom.

#### Who has access to my recordings?

All recordings created with Fathom are 100% private. They can only be seen if you share your recordings or highlights with others.

#### Is Fathom secure?

![Image 332](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/vanta.svg) ![Image 333](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/zoom.png)

Yes. Fathom is hosted and developed following security best practices including end-to-end encryption, robust monitoring, and regular 3rd party penetration testing. Fathom has completed a SOC2 Type 2 audit as well as extensive security review by Zoom as part of being a Zoom Apps Launch Partner. Full details at [trust.fathom.video](https://trust.fathom.video/)

#### Should I be concerned about my privacy?

We take privacy seriously.¬† We‚Äôve gone out of our way to eliminate 3rd party cookies and forced our legal team to write a terms of service and privacy policy that can be understood without a law degree.

#### Will people be uncomfortable with recording Zoom calls?

If you've not recorded calls before we've found that you're much more likely to worry about this than your attendees ever will. In fact, inside of certain roles like Sales & Customer Success already over 90% of calls are recorded (with the exceptions typically being sensitive legal or enterprise sales).

We've also seen that over 50% of attendees would like access to the call recording, so rather than be worried they'll be excited that you're recording the call for their benefit as well (don't worry, Fathom allows you to share the call recording without sharing your highlights & notes).

Finally, if at any time your attendees are uncomfortable, Fathom gives you a way to pause recording.
