Deep Graph Library
==================

Easy Deep Learning on Graphs

[Install](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html) [GitHub](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/)

### Framework Agnostic

Build your models with PyTorch, TensorFlow or Apache MXNet.

![Image 2: framework](https://www.dgl.ai/assets/images/framework.jpg)

### Efficient and Scalable

Fast and memory-efficient message passing primitives for training Graph Neural Networks. Scale to giant graphs via multi-GPU acceleration and distributed training infrastructure.

### Diverse Ecosystem

DGL empowers a variety of domain-specific projects including [DGL-KE](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke) for learning large-scale knowledge graph embeddings, [DGL-LifeSci](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci) for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, and many others.
