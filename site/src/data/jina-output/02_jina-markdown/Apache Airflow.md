Apache Airflow®
---------------

##### Apache Airflow® is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

[Install Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/start.html)

#### Principles

##### Scalable

Apache Airflow® has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow™ is ready to scale to infinity.

##### Dynamic

Apache Airflow® pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.

##### Extensible

Easily define your own operators and extend libraries to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

##### Elegant

Apache Airflow® pipelines are lean and explicit. Parametrization is built into its core using the powerful Jinja templating engine.

#### Features

##### Pure Python

No more command-line or XML black-magic! Use standard Python features to create your workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops to dynamically generate tasks. This allows you to maintain full flexibility when building your workflows.

##### Useful UI

Monitor, schedule and manage your workflows via a robust and modern web application. No need to learn old, cron-like interfaces. You always have full insight into the status and logs of completed and ongoing tasks.

##### Robust Integrations

Apache Airflow® provides many plug-and-play operators that are ready to execute your tasks on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and many other third-party services. This makes Airflow easy to apply to current infrastructure and extend to next-gen technologies.

##### Easy to Use

Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow. Apache Airflow® does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure, and more.

##### Open Source

Wherever you want to share your improvement you can do this by opening a PR. It’s simple as that, no barriers, no prolonged procedures. Airflow has many active users who willingly share their experiences. Have any questions? Check out our buzzing slack.
