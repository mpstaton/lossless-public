“When we were looking for a partner, the default approach was to go with one of the large consultancies, who were all knocking at our door to do AI work for our portfolio. But we didn’t want consultants. We wanted practitioners that were experts in these technologies, who also had industry experience. We needed people our companies could really trust to produce innovations that were impactful.”

“Working with Tribe was one of the best decisions of my career. Tribe’s team members weren’t just order-takers aimed at pleasing us. They offered conflicting and compelling insights and really pushed the project forward with a critical perspective. That confidence to ‘argue’ for improved outcomes is invaluable.”
