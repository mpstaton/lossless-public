Language 

Rust
====

A language empowering everyone  
to build reliable and efficient software.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Get Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)[Version 1.85.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html)

Why Rust?
---------

### Performance

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

### Reliability

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

### Productivity

Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

Build it in Rust
----------------

In 2018, the Rust community decided to improve the programming experience for a few distinct domains (see [the 2018 roadmap](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html)). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some awesome guides on how to get started.

### Command Line

Whip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem. Rust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease.

### WebAssembly

Use Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time. Publish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races.

### Networking

Predictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability. Rust is great for network services.

### Embedded

Targeting low-resource devices? Need low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences? Rust has you covered.

Rust in production
------------------

Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know and love, like [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/), [Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/), and [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/), uses Rust. **From startups to large corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.**

> My biggest compliment to Rust is that it's boring, and this is an amazing compliment.
