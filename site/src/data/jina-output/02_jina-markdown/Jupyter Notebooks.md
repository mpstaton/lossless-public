JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface
------------------------------------------------

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

[Try it in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try) [Install JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)

Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface
------------------------------------------------

The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

[Try it in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try) [Install the Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

![Image 9: icon to represent a language](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/language.svg)

### Language of choice

Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.

![Image 10: icon to represent sharing a notebook](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/share.svg)

### Share notebooks

Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

![Image 11: icon to represent an interactive widget](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/widget.svg)

### Interactive output

Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

![Image 12: spark logo to represent big data](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/spark.svg)

### Big data integration

Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow.

![Image 13: jupyterhub logo](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/hublogo.svg)

A multi-user version of the notebook designed for companies, classrooms and research labs

![Image 14: authentication icon](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/authentication.svg)

### Pluggable authentication

Manage users and authentication with PAM, OAuth or integrate with your own directory service system.

![Image 15: icon to represent centralized deployment](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/central.svg)

### Centralized deployment

Deploy the Jupyter Notebook to thousands of users in your organization on centralized infrastructure on- or off-site.

![Image 16: container icon](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/container.svg)

### Container friendly

Use Docker and Kubernetes to scale your deployment, isolate user processes, and simplify software installation.

![Image 17: icon to represent data](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/data.svg)

### Code meets data

Deploy the Notebook next to your data to provide unified software management and data access within your organization.

Voilà: Share your results
-------------------------

Voilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share.

Open Standards for Interactive Computing
----------------------------------------

Project Jupyter promotes open standards that third-party developers can leverage to build customized applications. Think HTML and CSS for interactive computing on the web.

![Image 47: icon to represent notebook format](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/notebook-format.svg)

### Notebook Document Format

Jupyter Notebooks are an open document format based on JSON. They contain a complete record of the user's sessions and include code, narrative text, equations, and rich output.

![Image 48: icon to represent a protocol](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/protocol.svg)

### Interactive Computing Protocol

The Notebook communicates with computational Kernels using the Interactive Computing Protocol, an open network protocol based on JSON data over ZMQ, and WebSockets.

![Image 49: icon that looks like a terminal represents kernel](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/kernel.svg)

### The Kernel

Kernels are processes that run interactive code in a particular programming language and return output to the user. Kernels also respond to tab completion and introspection requests.
