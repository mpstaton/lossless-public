"StackBlitz unlocks a true one-click startup experience with the full stack running in the browser—**it's a game-changer.**"

Ilya Grigorik Principal Engineer at Shopify

##### Powered by WebContainers

**Faster** and **more secure**  
than local.
============================================

[**Introducing WebContainers:** Run Node.js in your browser Read the release ![Image 11](https://stackblitz.com/_astro/img/pages/home/card-bg-webcontainer.png)](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers)

Bolt is powered by WebContainers, the first WebAssembly-based micro operating system which boots entire development environments in milliseconds, securely within your browser tab.

### What about online IDEs?

**Legacy cloud-based IDEs** run on remote servers and **stream the results back** to your browser. This approach yields **few security benefits** and provides a **worse experience** than your local machine in nearly every way.

**With StackBlitz, all compute occurs inside your browser**, making use of decades of speed and security innovations.
