Our Culture

A Legacy Fueled by Culture
--------------------------

Flexibility and Diversity

### Great People is the Future

At Archon, our culture comes first. We offer a state of the art flexible work environment tailored to your style and ambitions. As a remote-first company within European timezones, you have the ultimate freedom to work from wherever you want. We also host regular on-sites in our downtown Copenhagen offices to foster in-person collaboration and connection. We do this to ensure that we don’t miss out on all the good watercooler moments.  
  
Our team is as diverse as it is talented. We work very closely with one of the coolest gaming studios in Denmark, so you’ll mingle with quite a diverse group of game designers, artists, and even historic sword-fighting champions. This blend of skills and unique perspectives fuels our innovation and keeps things exciting.   
  
At Archon, we’re proud to offer a culture that’s dynamic, supportive, and perfectly suited to help you thrive.
