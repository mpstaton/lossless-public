LangGraph sets the foundation for how we can build and scale AI workloads — from conversational agents, complex task automation, to custom LLM-backed experiences that 'just work'. The next chapter in building complex production-ready features with LLMs is agentic, and with LangGraph and LangSmith, LangChain delivers an out-of-the-box solution to iterate quickly, debug immediately, and scale effortlessly.”\n\n![Image 52](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b8cd72835ceeacd4449a53/667b26a1b4576291d6a9335b_garrett%20spong%201.webp)\n\nGarrett Spong\n\nPrincipal SWE\n\n![Image 53](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b8cd72835ceeacd4449a53/6679de9dc4e7bee218d4b058_Norwegian-Cruise-Line-Logo%202-2.webp)\n\n“LangGraph has been instrumental for our AI development. Its robust framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs has transformed how we evaluate and optimize the performance of our AI guest-facing solutions. LangGraph enables granular control over the agent's thought process, which has empowered us to make data-driven and deliberate decisions to meet the diverse needs of our guests.”\n\n![Image 54](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b8cd72835ceeacd4449a53/667b265bed5f5a9d26d6b7d6_andres%20torres%201.webp)\n\nAndres Torres\n\nSr. Solutions Architect\n\n![Image 55](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b8cd72835ceeacd4449a53/667c6f809f0ebc7b1d72a99b_Replit.png)\n\n“It's easy to build the prototype of a coding agent, but deceptively hard to improve its reliability.

What’s the difference?\n\nNo. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.\n\nHow is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?\n\nOther agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.\n\nDoes LangGraph impact the performance of my app?\n\nLangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.\n\nIs LangGraph open source? Is it free?\n\nYes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.\n\nHow are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?\n\nLangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus an integrated developer studio.\n\nLangGraph (open source)\n\nLangGraph Platform\n\nFeatures\n\nDescription\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nStateful orchestration framework for agentic applications\n\nScalable infrastructure for deploying LangGraph applications  \n\nSDKs\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nPython and JavaScript\n\nPython and JavaScript  \n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nHTTP APIs\n\nNone\n\nYes - useful for retrieving & updating state or long-term memory, or creating a configurable assistant  \n\nStreaming\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nBasic\n\nDedicated mode for token-by-token messages  \n\nCheckpointer\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nCommunity contributed\n\nSupported out-of-the-box  \n\nPersistence Layer\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nSelf-managed\n\nManaged Postgres with efficient storage  \n\nDeployment\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nSelf-managed\n\n\\- Cloud SaaS  \n\\- Free self-hosted  \n\\-  Enterprise  \n(BYOC or paid self-hosted)  \n\nScalability\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nSelf-managed\n\nAuto-scaling of task queues and servers  \n\nFault-tolerance\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nSelf-managed\n\nAutomated retries  \n\nConcurrency Control\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nSimple threading\n\nSupports double-texting  \n\nScheduling\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nNone\n\nCron scheduling  \n\nMonitoring\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nNone\n\nIntegrated with LangSmith for observability  \n\nIDE integration\n\nPrices for traces vary depending on the data retention period you've set.\n\nLangGraph Studio for Desktop\n\nLangGraph Studio for Desktop & Cloud  \n\nWhat are my deployment options for LangGraph Platform?\n\nWe currently have the following deployment options for LangGraph applications:  \n  \n‍**Self-Hosted Lite**: A free (up to 1M nodes executed), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner. This version requires a LangSmith API key and logs all usage to LangSmith. Fewer features are available than in paid plans.  \n‍**Cloud SaaS:** Fully managed and hosted as part of LangSmith, with automatic updates and zero maintenance.  \n‍**Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** Deploy LangGraph Platform within your VPC, provisioned and run as a service. Keep data in your environment while outsourcing the management of the service.  \n**Self-Hosted Enterprise:** Deploy LangGraph entirely on your own infrastructure.\n\nIs LangGraph Platform open source?\n\nNo. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.  \n  \nThere is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but will eventually be a paid service. We will always give ample notice before charging for a service and reward our early adopters with preferential pricing. The Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) and Self-Hosted Enterprise options are also paid services.
