Just a week ago I told an engineer on the Meta DevX team to check out Pear and see how far behind Meta was. I worked in mostly Hack (PHP), Python, and Javascript at Meta. My current startup requires almost all Swift iOS. PearAI has brought me from complete noob to at least Senior Engineer productivity in Swift iOS in less than a month. Finally, because I use the various LLMs mostly for coding I've canceled my Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT subscriptions since switching, saving $30+/month.\n\nConnor Clancy\n\nFounder of Taste, prev 5 years @ Meta\n\nPearAI has been a great help with my side projects and learning new programming languages. What sets it apart from standard AI chat tools is its ability to understand my codebase and file context, making the development process more streamlined. It's a useful tool for developers who want contextual AI assistance while coding. I wish my company adopted an AI code editor like this.\n\nJackson Z\n\nBig Tech Software Engineer, Prev.
