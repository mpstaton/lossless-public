Like, we didn’t do the move before, we didn’t do the move after. So there was a lot of human resources and time saved here. That was a very good experience. And again, from a cost perspective, it was highly optimized.”\n\n![Image 24](https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/profile-achi-solomon-alt-1.jpg)\n\n**Achi Solomon**\n\nDirector of DevOps\n\nCase study\n\n### Bede Gaming automatically optimizes K8s workloads with no risk to performance\n\n[Read the case study](https://cast.ai/case-studies/bede-gaming/)\n\n“In my mind, it’s one less thing to worry about, and therefore teams can be focused on other things of potentially higher value.
