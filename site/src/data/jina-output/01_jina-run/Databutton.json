We charge 2 credits for each compute-hour on your app's backend when deployed ‚Äì i.e. when the backend of your application is triggered and does work). Deployment to custom domains is included on the $50/mo \"Launch\" plan and above.\n\n#### How does deployment and hosting work?\n\nWe provide a 1-click deploy experience to \\[username\\].databutton.app/\\[appname\\]. We also support deployment to custom domains (available at the $50 \"Launch\" plan and higher). We provide this for convenience and ease of use. If you want to deploy on your infrastructure, you can reach out to us.\n\n#### Do I need to bring my own model/LLM key(s) to use Databutton?\n\nNo, not to use the Databutton AI app developer! We're always evaluating the best models available for the agentic framework you interact with in Databutton and associated costs are covered in your Databutton credit usage.\n\n#### What if I want to make an AI-driven app?\n\nIf you want to build an app utilising a model or service (e.g. GPT-4, ElevenLabs, etc.), you will either need to bring your own API key/secrets for use in your application or request an API key/secrets from your application‚Äôs users.\n\n#### Who owns my app‚Äôs code and IP?\n\nYou own your code and IP. Databutton is a facilitator in realising your big idea; we do not have any claim to your IP. We host your code on our service in order to make it easy to iterate, deploy, and provide a more on-rails experience.\n\n[##### Docs](https://docs.databutton.com/)[##### Discord](https://discord.gg/K9aHvmmFtH)[##### About](https://www.databutton.com/about)[##### Champions](https://www.databutton.com/about/champions)\n\n[##### Medium](https://medium.com/databutton)[##### YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXO5TOoT_BX1UMmqcaHTMhQ)[##### X](https://twitter.com/DatabuttonHQ)[##### LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/databutton/?originalSubdomain=no)[##### Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/databuttonhq/)[##### TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@databutton)\n\n[##### Privacy Policy](https://app.termly.io/document/privacy-policy/ccfc682c-75d1-4c85-b43b-f6809a125e37)[##### Terms of Service](https://app.termly.io/document/terms-of-service/65ebe396-8b8d-4748-8ee6-b98532827ed9)[##### Cookies](https://app.termly.io/document/cookie-policy/c7bf9690-7a5b-42b2-9546-894eb8be4ce3)[Consent Preferences](https://www.databutton.com/#)\n\n¬© 2024 Databutton AS\n\nTordenskiolds gate 3, 0160 Oslo\n\nOrg. nr. 927 269 252",
