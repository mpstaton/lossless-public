To get started with MAX either locally, or via a Docker Container, just [**Install MAX**](https://docs.modular.com/max/install) or follow one our tutorials like [**Deploying Llama 3 on GPU with MAX Serve**](https://docs.modular.com/max/tutorials/max-serve-local-to-cloud).\n\nWhat does MAX replace?\n\nWe created MAX to solve the fragmented and confusing array of AI tools that plague the industry today. Our unified toolkit is designed to help the world build high-performance AI pipelines and deploy them to any hardware removing the need for hardware vendor specific libraries. [**You can read more in our blog post.**](https://www.modular.com/blog/introducing-max-24-6-a-gpu-native-generative-ai-platform)\n\nHow much do I have to pay to use MAX?\n\nMAX is a free and permissive AI inference framework that enables developers and enterprises to develop and deploy AI inference workloads on any hardware type, into any type of environment (including into production). We offer MAX Enterprise for organizations seeking enterprise support, and you can read more on our [**Pricing Page**](https://www.modular.com/pricing).\n\nIs MAX compatible with my current stack?\n\nAlmost certainly. MAX is built without vendor-specific hardware libraries, enabling it to scale effortlessly across a wide range of CPUs and GPUs. We tightly integrate with AI ecosystem tools such as Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, and have fully extensible API surface. MAX Serve is available in a ready-to-deploy containers, and provides an OpenAI API endpoint API surface. We work and deploy easily with Docker and Kubernetes. [**Read more here**](https://docs.modular.com/max/intro).\n\nWhat models does MAX currently support?\n\nMAX supports model formats provided by Hugging Face, PyTorch, ONNX and MAX Graphs (our model format). We have a fully integrated LLM serving and execution stack that provides SOTA performance out-of-the-box. [**You can read more about the models here**](https://docs.modular.com/max/model-formats).\n\nFree to start.
