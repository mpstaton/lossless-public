Account](https://dashboard.opengraph.io/register)\n\nNeed more requests? [Contact us](https://www.opengraph.io/support) for more information regarding custom plans.\n\n### How Requests are Counted\n\nWhen explicitly using some of our advanced features, a single API request may consume more than 1 request for your billing cycle.\n\n*   A standard request is always 1 request.\n*   Any cache hit, is always 1 request.\n*   Requests explicitly specify use of a proxy, full\\_render, or screenshot will be more than 1 request.\n\nThe \"Request Used\" table details the number of requests used by each feature.\n\n#### Request Used\n\n| Request Type | Requests Used | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| request | 1 | A request refers to a single API call to our system. Each time you use the API to retrieve data from a website, it counts as one request. |\n| full\\_render | 10 | A full\\_render request involves rendering the target web page in a headless browser, providing access to the entire HTML content of the page. This option is ideal for scenarios that require extensive data extraction from dynamic websites. |\n| use\\_proxy | 10 | The use\\_proxy option routes your API request through one of our proxy servers, effectively concealing your IP address. This feature is invaluable for bypassing IP blocks on websites and ensuring seamless data scraping. |\n| use\\_premium | 20 | The use\\_premium option is suggested for particularly difficult sites to scrape. |\n| use\\_superior | 30 | The use\\_superior option is tailored for highly challenging scraping scenarios. By leveraging our superior proxy feature, you can overcome stringent bot detection mechanisms on the toughest websites and access critical data. |\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Do you charge for failed requests?\n\nWe try not to charge when a request fails outright (e.g. 500 error / DNS timeout / etc). Things get a bit more fuzzy if we are talking about not getting back good data from our request, as determining the criteria for “no results” can be challenging, and the request is utilizing resources on our end.\n\n#### What's the difference between HybridGraph and OpenGraph in results?\n\nMany websites like Twitter block bots to prevent link unfurling activity, the list below breaks down the difference between openGraph and hybridGraph:\n\n*   hybridGraph: Mix between HTML Inferred and OpenGraph Data + our own implementation to talk to websites.\n*   openGraph: Only values provided from the website\n*   htmlInferred: Values yielded from the content of the website\n\n#### Why is your free plan so limited in the number of requests?\n\nUnfortunately, we are constantly trying to battle abuse of our free service, and this is the result. People will jump through a lot of hoops to save $20 a month.\n\nIf you end up using the product for anything more than development, we would recommend switching to the paid plan. If you end up being dissatisfied with the service, or just find it not to be a fit, reach out to us and let us know… we will be happy to help you out.\n\n#### Is there any validation and filtering going on at your end for sanitising the data before it comes back to us?\n\nWe do not perform any sanitizing of data that comes back from sites we process.\n\n#### What are the steps to delete user data and account on OpenGraph.io, and how can users contact the support team to request the deletion of their data?\n\nAs part of our commitment to user privacy, we provide clear instructions on how users can request their data to be deleted. If you wish to delete your account, you can do so by going to your profile page and selecting the ‘delete account’ option. Upon deletion, all of your data will be permanently removed from our systems. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can contact our support team at support@opengraph.io and request that your data be deleted. We will process your request promptly and with the utmost care to ensure that your data is completely removed from our servers.\n\n### Still have Questions? 🙋\n\nCan't find the answer you're looking for?
