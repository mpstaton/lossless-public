Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.\n\n[Try it in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try) [Install JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)\n\n ![Image 8: example notebook of Lorenz differential equations](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/jupyterpreview.png)\n\nJupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.\n\n[Try it in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try) [Install the Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)\n\n![Image 9: icon to represent a language](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/language.svg)\n\n### Language of choice\n\nJupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.\n\n![Image 10: icon to represent sharing a notebook](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/share.svg)\n\n### Share notebooks\n\nNotebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).\n\n![Image 11: icon to represent an interactive widget](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/widget.svg)\n\n### Interactive output\n\nYour code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.\n\n![Image 12: spark logo to represent big data](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/spark.svg)\n\n### Big data integration\n\nLeverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow.\n\n![Image 13: jupyterhub logo](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/hublogo.svg)\n\nA multi-user version of the notebook designed for companies, classrooms and research labs\n\n![Image 14: authentication icon](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/authentication.svg)\n\n### Pluggable authentication\n\nManage users and authentication with PAM, OAuth or integrate with your own directory service system.\n\n![Image 15: icon to represent centralized deployment](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/central.svg)\n\n### Centralized deployment\n\nDeploy the Jupyter Notebook to thousands of users in your organization on centralized infrastructure on- or off-site.\n\n![Image 16: container icon](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/container.svg)\n\n### Container friendly\n\nUse Docker and Kubernetes to scale your deployment, isolate user processes, and simplify software installation.\n\n![Image 17: icon to represent data](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/data.svg)\n\n### Code meets data\n\nDeploy the Notebook next to your data to provide unified software management and data access within your organization.\n\n[Learn more about JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)\n\n ![Image 18: examples of Voilà dashboards](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/voilapreview.png)\n\nVoilà: Share your results\n-------------------------\n\nVoilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share.\n\n[Try it in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try) [Install Voilà](https://jupyter.org/install)\n\n### Currently in use at\n\n*   [![Image 19: Anaconda](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/anaconda.svg)](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n*   [![Image 20: Ayasdi](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/ayasdi.svg)](https://ayasdi.com/)\n*   [![Image 21: Berkeley](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/Berkeley.svg)](https://www.berkeley.edu/)\n*   [![Image 22: Bloomberg](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/bloomberg.svg)](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n*   [![Image 23: BrynMawr](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/brynmawr.svg)](https://www.brynmawr.edu/)\n*   [![Image 24: CalPoly](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/calpoly.svg)](https://www.calpoly.edu/)\n*   [![Image 25: Clemson](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/clemson.svg)](https://www.clemson.edu/)\n*   [![Image 26: CoCalc](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/cocalc.svg)](https://cocalc.com/)\n*   [![Image 27: CodeNeuro](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/codeneuro.svg)](http://codeneuro.org/)\n*   [![Image 28: The Data Incubator](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/tdi.svg)](https://www.thedataincubator.com/)\n*   [![Image 29: George Washington University](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/washington.svg)](https://www.gwu.edu/)\n*   [![Image 30: Google](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/google.svg)](https://www.google.com/)\n*   [![Image 31: IBM](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/IBM.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/)\n*   [![Image 32: Janelia](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/janelia.svg)](https://www.janelia.org/)\n*   [![Image 33: Los Angeles Times](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/latimes.svg)](https://www.latimes.com/)\n*   [![Image 34: Michigan State University](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/michigan-state.svg)](https://msu.edu/)\n*   [![Image 35: Microsoft](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/Microsoft.svg)](https://www.microsoft.com/)\n*   [![Image 36: NASA](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/NASA.svg)](https://www.nasa.gov/)\n*   [![Image 37: NetApp](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/netapp.svg)](https://www.netapp.com/)\n*   [![Image 38: NSite](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/nsite.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nsite-llc/about/)\n*   [![Image 39: NYU](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/NYU.svg)](https://www.nyu.edu/)\n*   [![Image 40: Oracle](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/oracle.svg)](https://www.oracle.com/)\n*   [![Image 41: OReilly](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/oreilly.svg)](https://www.oreilly.com/)\n*   [![Image 42: QuantStack](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/quantstack.svg)](https://quantstack.net/)\n*   [![Image 43: Rackspace](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/rackspace.svg)](https://developer.rackspace.com/)\n*   [![Image 44: Sheffield](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/sheffield.svg)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/)\n*   [![Image 45: Software Carpentry](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/carpentry.svg)](https://software-carpentry.org/)\n*   [![Image 46: SoundCloud](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/soundcloud.svg)](https://www.soundcloud.com/)\n\nOpen Standards for Interactive Computing\n----------------------------------------\n\nProject Jupyter promotes open standards that third-party developers can leverage to build customized applications. Think HTML and CSS for interactive computing on the web.\n\n![Image 47: icon to represent notebook format](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/notebook-format.svg)\n\n### Notebook Document Format\n\nJupyter Notebooks are an open document format based on JSON. They contain a complete record of the user's sessions and include code, narrative text, equations, and rich output.\n\n![Image 48: icon to represent a protocol](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/protocol.svg)\n\n### Interactive Computing Protocol\n\nThe Notebook communicates with computational Kernels using the Interactive Computing Protocol, an open network protocol based on JSON data over ZMQ, and WebSockets.\n\n![Image 49: icon that looks like a terminal represents kernel](https://jupyter.org/assets/homepage/kernel.svg)\n\n### The Kernel\n\nKernels are processes that run interactive code in a particular programming language and return output to the user. Kernels also respond to tab completion and introspection requests.\n\nProject Jupyter\n---------------\n\n*   [Try](https://jupyter.org/try)\n*   [Install](https://jupyter.org/install)\n*   [Get Involved](https://jupyter.org/community)\n*   [Documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/)\n*   [News](https://blog.jupyter.org/)\n*   [Social](https://jupyter.org/social)\n*   [Governance](https://jupyter.org/governance/)\n*   [Security](https://jupyter.org/security)\n*   [About](https://jupyter.org/about)\n\nSubprojects\n-----------\n\n*   [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder)\n*   [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)\n*   [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/)\n*   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/)\n*   [Voilà](https://voila.readthedocs.io/)\n*   [Widgets](https://jupyter.org/widgets)\n\nFollow us\n---------\n\n*   [GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/)\n*   [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ProjectJupyter)\n*   [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/jupyter.org)\n*   [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@projectjupyter)\n\nLegal\n-----\n\n*   [Privacy](https://jupyter.org/privacy)\n\n![Image 50: Project Jupyter logo](https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/rectanglelogo-blacktext-blackbody-blackplanets.svg)The Jupyter® and Jupyter Logo® trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office by [LF Charities](https://lf-charities.org/). © 2025",
