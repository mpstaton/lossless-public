During beta we found some bugs in Apple's text layout engine that we just could not fix. Our solution? Writing our own text layout manager… from scratch. Not only did this fix the bugs, but it also boosted our editor's performance. We're not messing around!)\n\nBut even the best text engine in the world means nothing unless you actually enjoy spending your time in the app. So, how does Nova look?\n\n* * *\n\nThe Workflows.\n--------------\n\n### Nova doesn't just help you code. It helps your code run.\n\nYou can easily create build and run tasks for your projects. We didn't have them in Coda, but boy do we have them now. They're custom scripts that can be triggered at any time by toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts.\n\nImagine building content, and with the single click of a button watching as Nova fires up your local server, grabs the appropriate URL, and opens a browser for you, instantly. Just think of the time you'll save.\n\nNova supports separate **Build**, **Run**, and **Clean** tasks. It can open a report when run. And the scripts can be written in a variety of languages.\n\n* * *\n\nDebugging.\n----------\n\n### Sometimes you need to get into the details.\n\nNova has built-in debugging support for PHP, Python, Chrome, Node.js, Deno, and our very own [Playdate Simulator](https://play.date/dev/). It features a new Debug sidebar, a Debugger in the console, breakpoints, and more. It's really great.\n\nNeed support for a different language? Check our [extensions library,](https://extensions.panic.com/) or create your own using Nova's [extensions API](https://docs.nova.app/).\n\n![Image 3: Screenshot displaying Nova's debugging features.](https://nova.app/tools/debugging.png)\n\n* * *\n\nThe Tools.\n----------\n\n### Now, this is important. Editing text is just part of what Nova does.\n\nWe've bundled in extremely useful tools to help you get your work done quickly and efficiently. They're all fast and native too, of course.\n\n![Image 4: The New Tab button gives quick access to new Document, File Browser, Local and Remote Terminal tabs](https://nova.app/tools/new-tab.png)\n\nThe **New Tab** button doesn't just open a fresh document. although it does that, too.\n\nClick it to quickly access a feature-packed **Transmit file browser**, or a super-convenient **Prompt terminal**, all right inside Nova.\n\n![Image 5: Customize the Sidebar Dock using any of the default options: Clips, Files, Find, Git, Issues, Publish, Remote, Reports, and Symbols](https://nova.app/tools/sidebars.png)\n\nMeanwhile, Nova's **sidebar** is packed with power. A local file browser. A remote file browser. Find across your project's files. A symbol navigator. Text clips. Git. Task reports. Issues. And file tracking and publishing.\n\nThe sidebar can also be split to show multiple tools at once, on the left and/or right side of your editor. And you can drag your favorite tools into the sidebar dock at the top for one-click access.\n\n![Image 6: Git status is integrated across Nova: in the Files sidebar, the editor, and a dedicated Git sidebar](https://nova.app/tools/git.png)\n\nNova also has **Git** source control tools built-in. Clone. Click-to-clone. Initialize a repo. Fetch and pull. Stage and unstage. Commit. Push. You know the drill.\n\nGit status is available both in the editor and the sidebar. And a useful \"Show Last Change for Line\" pop-up explains commits.\n\n![Image 7: Image showing the comparison view for file diffing in Nova.](https://nova.app/tools/comparison.png)\n\nSlide open the **comparison view** to diff a file against a Git commit or another file, or even diff two specific commits, and quickly see what's changed.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Extensions.\n---------------\n\n### Nova has a robust [extensions API](https://docs.nova.app/).\n\nA Nova extension can do lots of things, like add support for new languages, extend the sidebar, draw beautiful new themes and syntax colors, validate different code, and much more.\n\nEven better, extensions are written in JavaScript, so anyone can write them. And Nova includes built-in extension templates for fast development.\n\n### Check out some of this week’s popular extensions…\n\n[![Image 8: Extension icon for Python](https://nova.app/images/extensions/net.danwatson.Python.png) **Python** 1.4.1 Dan Watson Batteries-included Python support for Nova.](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/net.danwatson/net.danwatson.Python)[![Image 9: Extension icon for Beautify](https://nova.app/images/extensions/patrickvuarnoz.beautify.png) **Beautify** 1.8 Patrick A.

Nova has a whole host of settings. We have easily customizable key bindings. We have custom, quickly-switchable workspace layouts. And we have loads of editor tweaks, from matching brackets to overscroll.\n\n(And if there's something you need to work that Nova doesn't have, just let us know! Nova is always changing, always growing.)\n\n![Image 14: The grid of preference panes.](https://nova.app/settings/all.png) ![Image 15: The General preferences
