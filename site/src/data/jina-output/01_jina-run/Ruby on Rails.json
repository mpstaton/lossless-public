Join us!\n\n[Meet the Rails team](https://rubyonrails.org/community)\n\nEverything you need.\n====================\n\n#### **Rails is a full-stack framework.** It ships with all the tools needed to build amazing web apps on both the front and back end.\n\nRendering HTML templates, updating databases, sending and receiving emails, maintaining live pages via WebSockets, enqueuing jobs for asynchronous work, storing uploads in the cloud, providing solid security protections for common attacks. Rails does it all and so much more.\n\n###### app/models/article.rb\n\n```ruby\nclass Article < ApplicationRecord\n  belongs_to :author, default: -> { Current.user }\n  has_many   :comments\n\n  has_one_attached :cover_image\n  has_rich_text :content, encrypted: true\n  enum status: %i[ drafted published ]\n\n  scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc).limit(25) }\n\n  after_save_commit :deliver_later, if: :published?\n\n  def byline\n    \"Written by #{author.name} on #{created_at.to_s(:short)}\"\n  end\n\n  def deliver_later\n    Article::DeliveryJob.perform_later(self)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Active Records make modeling easy.\n\nDatabases come to life with business logic encapsulated in rich objects. Modeling associations between tables, providing callbacks when saved, encrypting sensitive data seamlessly, and expressing SQL queries beautifully.\n\n###### app/controllers/articles\\_controller.rb\n\n```ruby\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\n  def index\n    @articles = Article.recent\n  end\n\n  def show\n    @article = Article.find(params[:id])\n    fresh_when etag: @article\n  end\n\n  def create\n    article = Article.create!(article_params)\n    redirect_to article\n  end\n\n  private\n    def article_params\n      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Action Controllers handle all requests.\n\nControllers expose the domain model to the web, process incoming parameters, set caching headers, and render templates, responding with either HTML or JSON.\n\n###### app/views/articles/show.html.erb\n\n```erb\n<h1><%= @article.title %></h1>\n\n<%= image_tag @article.cover_image.url %>\n\n<p><%= @article.content %></p>\n\n<%= link_to \"Edit\", edit_article_path(@article) if Current.user.admin? %>\n```\n\n### Action Views mix Ruby and HTML.\n\nTemplates can use the full versatility of Ruby, excessive code is extracted into helpers, and the domain model is used directly and interwoven with the HTML.\n\n###### config/routes.rb\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  resources :articles do    # /articles, /articles/1\n    resources :comments     # /articles/1/comments, /comments/1\n  end\n\n  root to: \"articles#index\" # /\nend\n```\n\n### Action Dispatch routes URLs.\n\nConfigure how URLs connect to the controllers using the routing domain language. Routes expose the bundle of actions that go together as a resource: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy.\n\nOptimized for happiness.\n========================\n\nRails has united and cultivated a strong tribe around a **wide set of heretical thoughts** about the nature of programming and programmers. Understanding these thoughts will help you understand the design of the framework.\n\n[Read the Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)\n\nLet’s get started.\n==================\n\n[###### Learning ### Read the guides.
