    "description": "A color picker app for the real world. Find, collect and organize all the colors around you. A designer's delight! As a designer or creative, we often come across colours that we want to use in our later projects but as at the time, have no way of remembering them but just trusting our brains to know what we saw. Litur saves you that headache.",
