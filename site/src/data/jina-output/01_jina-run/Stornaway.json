They are about journeys, experiences, scenarios – and above all, _conversations_ with your audience.**\n\nTraditional videos let viewers press play, pause and stop – that’s it. Interactive video takes it further by creating different paths for viewers to take or adding clickable links to other pages and resources. Once you starting looking into it, there are so many ways for people to engage with a video.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the more interactive you make your video, the more engaging it will be. So whether you are making video for marketing, sales or learning, there are plenty of advantages to going interactive.\n\nStornaway’s design is unique in that it lets you easily see and craft your whole user journey, with our visual Story Map interface.\n\nLearn more about interactive video in our article “[What is interactive video](https://www.stornaway.io/what-is-interactive-video/)?” – and watch Our Demo video above to see How to Make An Interactive Video with Stornaway.\n\n### [Where can I learn how to use Stornaway.io quickly?](https://www.stornaway.io/#)\n\n[Watch our 4 minute Getting Started video to find out.
