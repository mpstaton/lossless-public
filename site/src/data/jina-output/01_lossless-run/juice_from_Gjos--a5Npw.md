Alright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user shared some pretty detailed steps about using this new AI agent called CLA code. They went through installing the tool, initializing it, and even setting up vectal with infinite thinking. At first, I thought maybe there was a typo or something wrong with CLA code, especially since it says it's not available on anthropic console. But then I remembered that anthropic has been making progress recently. 

I started researching why CLA code isn't working. Maybe it's because of some network issues or temporary glitches. So, I suggested contacting anthropic support and hoping they'd fix the problem. That makes sense because if there's an issue with the console itself, even if CLA code doesn't work right away, other users might have already reported that CLA code is available but just not working.

Next, the user mentioned using cursor and vectal together for productivity. I thought about how productive this would be. Since they're talking about YOLO mode in curser and infinite thinking from CLA, it's suggesting a massive shift towards being more automated and focused. I wanted to make sure this was practical because while it's cool, the user might not have considered the time investment or mental health implications of starting so much on their own.

I also thought about how this could change everything in a professional setting, but maybe they're concerned about missing out on something like YAGA or other productivity tools. So I suggested balancing automation with still having some flexibility and personal growth through vectal and infinite thinking.

Overall, the user seems committed to using AI for their work, which is great, but they need to be aware of the potential downsides. I wanted to guide them towards understanding the trade-offs so they can make informed decisions about whether this tool will help them achieve their goals.
