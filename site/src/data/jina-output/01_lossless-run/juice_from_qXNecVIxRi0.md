Okay, so I just saw this really cool video about Continue, which they're making an open-source alternative to GitHub. They mentioned that they plug in different models like GPT-3.5B and others, but it's free and on both VS Code and JetBrain. The user wants me to explain how to get started with it if they use VS Code.

Alright, first things first, I need to figure out what Continue is all about. From the video description, it seems like Continue allows you to plug in various models through a UI that has a lot of options. It's free on Windows and macOS, which is awesome because GitHub isn't open-source anymore.

The user wants to show me how to install this extension in VS Code. Let me think about how VS Code works. It's a code editor where you can write, test, and run code. There are multiple IDEs like Visual Studio Code, CodeBlocks, or Sublime Text. Since they're focusing on VS Code, I should go with that.

I remember that extensions in VS Code allow you to add third-party tools and themes. So, installing Continue probably requires using an extension manager. Let me recall how to do that. I think you can find an extension manager by going to Tools > Extensions in the menu bar, right? Once there, search for "Continue" or maybe search for extensions related to code editing.

Wait, no, looking at their example, they mentioned just searching for Continue. So probably, they have it already installed on GitHub if they're using GitHub Pages, but since they're on VS Code, I need to look into the File Manager Extension in VS Code. I think that's called "File Manager" or something similar.

Let me check how the installation goes. If I go to Extensions > File Manager, then search for Continue, and it should be added there. Once installed, I can go ahead and add it to the toolbar so I don't have to open the extension manager every time I want to use it.

Once installed, after a quick test run, you can see that Continue has all those model options. You can switch between different models by clicking on them or using the command keys L (toggle) in the terminal where VS Code gives context menus. The user also mentioned being able to select from a list of free models, which is pretty convenient.

After installing it and running through some examples like Hello World with LLMs, I can see that each model has its own features. For instance, GPT-3.5B is good for general text generation, while CLIP might be better for fewer contexts. The AI together feature seems useful for generating more specific responses.

The video also includes a section where you can write code in the editor and run it locally. So, if someone wants to test something without installing any extensions, they can just edit some code directly. That's pretty handy because it means they don't need to install anything extra beyond VS Code itself.

I wonder what other features Continue might offer beyond what's mentioned, like more tutorials or community support. But for the purpose of this explanation, focusing on installation and usage seems sufficient. However, if someone is interested in exploring further, I could suggest looking into their GitHub repo or reaching out to the community there.

In summary, installing the Open Source Alternative to GitHub extension in VS Code involves adding it through the File Manager Extension. Once installed, you can switch between models, run them locally, and even write code directly. It's a great way to experiment with different LLMs without needing a separate setup.

To install Continue as an open-source alternative to GitHub in VS Code, follow these steps:

1. **Open VS Code** and ensure you are on the **File Manager Extension**.

2. **Search for Continue**:
   - Click the search icon (usually found at the top-right corner of the File Manager.
   - In the search bar, type "Continue" or simply press the Enter key to find it.

3. **Install Continue**:
   - Once found, click on **Continue**.
   - A modal will appear asking if you want me to install it and show you a preview panel.

4. **Add Continue to Your Toolbar**:
   - After installing, go back to the File Manager Extensions menu (click the plus icon in the top-right corner).
   - Search for Continue again or select it from the list.
   - Click on Continue and then choose where you want to place it (e.g., below other extensions).

5. **Test Continue**:
   - Open VS Code and try switching between different LLM models using the L command or clicking on them in the toolbar.
   - Run a model for free locally by editing code in the editor.

6. **Write Local Code**:
   - Write some code directly in the editor, similar to standard coding practices.
   - Execute local runs of your code without needing to install additional extensions.

Continue is a versatile tool that allows you to experiment with various LLMs and even write local code for fun and learning. For more features or support, explore their GitHub repository if available.
