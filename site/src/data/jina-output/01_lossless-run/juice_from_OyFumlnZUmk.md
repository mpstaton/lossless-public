Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this error where my application isn't working correctly. The user mentioned something about "simplify" and using AI chatbots to make the process easier. Let me break down what I understand from their explanation.

First, they talked about breaking down the application into just the authentication part. They said if everything else in the app is working fine on its own, then maybe that's the problem. So instead of having a whole project with all the code messing up, they suggest removing all other features and focusing only on making sure authentication works. That makes sense because if it doesn't work, maybe the issue is somewhere else.

Then there was this part about using "simplify." The user mentioned that sometimes you don't need to handle everything except for getting auth right. So instead of loading a bunch of code into AI, they take one piece of code at a time and only focus on the authentication function. This seems like it would make the problem easier because if just one part works, maybe all other parts are causing issues.

They also talked about setting up a GitHub repository specifically for branches. They said having multiple versions of your main branch can help you track changes and roll back easily in case of problems. That's helpful because if something goes wrong, you don't have to start from scratch every time.

The user mentioned that sometimes the error might be related to other parts of the app or even the environment itself. So they suggested taking a nap or sleeping if that keeps happening. It makes sense because if the problem is with the rest of the app and not just your authentication code, it could take a while without you being fresh.

They also gave some practical tips: removing unnecessary variables from your code, focusing on the core functionality, simplifying complex things into smaller pieces, and breaking down big problems. These strategies seem like they would help reduce the complexity in any coding scenario.

I think I get the gist of it, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply all these steps practically. Let me try applying some of these ideas step by step:

1. **Break Down the Application**: Look at your entire app and identify which parts are working fine on their own. Remove or simplify everything else so that if anything is wrong, it's not due to issues in other parts.

2. **Focus on Authentication**: Make sure authentication works right from the start. If you can get that done, then maybe all other problems are related to how your app interacts with it.

3. **Use a GitHub Repository for Branches**: Create separate files where each branch represents a version of your main project. This will help track what changes and allow easy rollback if needed.

4. **Take Breaks**: If you're stuck, take a short nap or sleep to refresh your mind on how you did it before. Sometimes things just fall into place without thinking about them for a while.

5. **Simplify Code**: Take one piece of code at a time and focus only on that part. Replace all other code with this single function until the problem goes away, then add everything back in and see if it works again.

6. **Identify Environmental Issues**: If you're still having problems after trying to simplify, check your environment for errors or issues that might be causing the bug without being related to your app's functionality.

I think these steps will help make any coding issue easier to resolve by focusing on the core problem and breaking it down into smaller parts. It also seems like using a GitHub repository as a tool can really help with managing different versions of your project to make it more manageable if issues arise.

To address the error in your application, follow these structured steps:

1. **Break Down Your Application**: Identify which components of your app are functioning independently. Remove or simplify all non-core functionalities so that any issues stem from other parts.

2. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Ensure authentication is working first. This sets a clear foundation and reduces the scope of possible issues elsewhere in your app.

3. **Use a GitHub Repository for Branches**: Create separate files for each version of your main project. This will help track changes and facilitate rollback if problems arise.

4. **Take Breaks**: If you're stuck, take a short nap or sleep to refresh your mindset on how you resolved the issue before.

5. **Simplify Code**: Replace one piece at a time with focused code. Test each part individually until issues resolve, then reintegrate everything back.

6. **Identify Environmental Issues**: Check for any environment-related problems that might be causing bugs unrelated to your app's functionality.

By following these steps, you can systematically reduce complexity and make debugging more manageable.
