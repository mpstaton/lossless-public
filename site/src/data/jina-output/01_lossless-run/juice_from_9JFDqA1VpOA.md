Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this problem. The user provided an HTML file and an image showing the code content on a webpage. My first step was to examine both files carefully. 

I noticed that the image included JavaScript functions with specific variable names like 'app' and 'tx'. In the HTML file, these were represented by data attributes. So, my immediate thought was to copy those attribute references into the JavaScript.

Next, I considered what each function did. The createTask function seemed to take an array of form properties and return a new task object with added tags. The updateTags function updated existing tasks' tag names, which required modifying the TX table structure.

I realized that using async/await in JavaScript would be beneficial for handling asynchronous operations efficiently. Also, I thought about how to reset the task state when a user clicks on an item in the form to prevent duplicates and improve user experience.

Finally, I decided to update the HTML to include the new functions by adding data attributes with the correct attribute names. This way, the image would accurately represent both the initial state before any changes and the final result after all operations are performed.

Looking at your code content, here's a concise breakdown of what needs to be done:

1. The main content is in `src/App.js`:
```javascript
// createTask - adds tags
function createTask(formProposition) {
    return { 
        name: proposition[0],
        tags: [proposition[1], proposition[2]],
        doneState: false,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
}

// updateTags - updates tag names
function updateTags(ticksToUpdate, newTagNames) {
    let txObj = tasks.find(row => row.name === ticksToUpdate);
    if (txObj) {
        txObj['tags'] = newTagNames;
        return txObj;
    }
    return null;
}
```

2. The image represents the initial state before any changes, and we need to update it.

3. Here's how I updated your HTML content:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="text-center">App - Final State</h1>
  <img src="https://preview.net img/600x400/https%3A%2F%2Fcscvcrh7jzg%2Fimages%2Fsrc/App.jpg" alt="Final State">
  <div class="row c-4">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h2 class="text-center mb-4">createTask</h2>
      <pre data-aos-list-enums="true" data-aos-list-initializes="false">
        <code list-enums>
          [[ { name: "cars", tags: ["car", "truck"] } ]]
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This will update the image to show your final state after all operations.
