Alright, let's dive into this. The user has provided a detailed interview transcript from a discussion about AI in education. They've asked for advice on how to share these insights and perhaps some last pieces of advice.

First, I notice they're an interviewer, Nick Maro, sharing his thoughts with the audience. He mentions the importance of precision in using AI and recognizing that everyone is investing in outcomes but missing the path. That's a key point—applying AI as a tool to overcome challenges rather than just trying it blindly.

He also talks about opportunities in globalization, nationalization, and border issues, along with the complexity of business environments. This leads into a focus on efficiency and emerging technologies like robotics. It's important to highlight how AI can be part of that future effort but needs strategic application.

The user emphasizes resilience: not getting discouraged by failures and focusing on creating value. They stress the importance of measuring results without losing sight of what they're looking for. This advice seems practical and actionable, which is great because it encourages participants to apply these insights directly.

They end with a call to action, inviting everyone to join next month's interview series about integrating AI with avatars as tutors. This shows engagement and looks forward to future opportunities.

Overall, the transcript covers strategic thinking, leveraging AI, addressing global challenges, and focusing on value creation. The advice provided is both encouraging and practical, fitting well into a discussion on education technology.

Thank you for joining the conversation! Your insights are invaluable, and I'm excited to share what we've learned with everyone.

Looking ahead, here are some last pieces of advice:

1. **Be Resilient and Persistent**: Understand that failure is part of the journey. Be patient and keep trying. Remember, you're not failing for the first time; you're setting a new standard for success.

2. **Measure and Focus on Outcomes**: Keep an eye on your progress and results. Don't focus solely on the path or challenges—emphasize what you achieve and how it aligns with your vision.

3. **Focus on Opportunities**: Identify the right opportunities in globalization, nationalization, and border issues to create new value. Stay ahead of these trends by staying updated on emerging technologies like AI.

4. **Measure Impact**: While everyone is investing in outcomes, focus on measuring the impact of what you build with AI. Ensure your solutions are aligned with your goals and that they drive real results for students or organizations.

5. **Plan and Measure Together**: Collaborate with others to plan your strategy, measure success, and stay on track. This ensures accountability and continuous improvement.

6. **Stay Connected**: Don’t stop at the first iteration; explore different approaches and refine your solutions as you iterate. Be open to new ideas and feedback.

7. **Focus on Value Creation**: Your AI solutions should create tangible value for users. Whether it’s personalized learning, avatars, or real-time support, ensure your platform enhances experiences rather than just solves problems.

8. **Be Part of the Future**: Embrace the fact that AI is a tool to help us achieve our goals. Collaborate with other players and stakeholders to shape the future of education technology together.

Let’s get ready for next month’s interview series on integrating AI with avatars as tutors! Stay connected, share your thoughts, and let’s explore how AI can transform the educational world!
