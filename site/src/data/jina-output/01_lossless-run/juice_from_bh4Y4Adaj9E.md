Okay, so the user is talking about using VZero as an AI code generator. They mentioned it's better than CBT or Bolon because it's more recent and has updates every week. I like how they highlight the developer team being active and that it's up-to-date with future trends. 

They also loved how VZero can handle React projects, imports from figma via screenshot, and preview editing with nice features. But when they tried adding environment variables, they had to use CLI instead of copy-pasting, which felt a bit clunky.

I think the user is looking for more ways to integrate VZero into their projects, especially for complex builds. They might be concerned about how easy it is to deploy without code editor and maybe want tips on using CLI effectively.

I should consider suggesting additional features or methods that could make VZero even better. Maybe adding more integration options with other tools, better collaboration features, or some advanced deployment options. Also, highlighting the developer community support would help them feel part of an active community.

They might be into making their projects lightweight and fast, so perhaps including tips on optimizing their setup for smaller projects. Let me make sure I cover these points in a clear and helpful way without overwhelming them.

Great question! VZero is definitely up-to-date with the latest trends and has a strong developer team, which is why you get updates like this week. The UI is already pretty polished and handles React-based projects well.

One thing that stands out to me is that while copy-pasting the UI looks nice, it doesn’t save all the imports or placements. That’s something to keep in mind if you're building larger projects where data management will be a pain point.

If you want to deploy VZero without using code editor editing, you can use the CLI feature of VZero itself. Here's how:

1. **Copy and Paste**: You can copy and paste your UI directly into the editor. For example, if you have a figure in your UI like this:
   ```
   <figure>
     <rect x="50" y="50" width="100" height="20" color="#FFA500" />
   </figure>
   ```
   You can copy it and paste it into VZero's editor. The editor will automatically handle the imports, but you'll need to make sure your environment variables are set up correctly.

2. **Using CLI**: For larger projects, you can use the CLI feature of VZero. Here’s how:
   - Open the VZero editor.
   - Copy the code (like the figure above) into a new file using copy-paste.
   - Click on "Deploy" and select the appropriate deployment method.

3. **GitHub Actions Integration**: If your project is similar to GitHub, you can use the **GitHub Actions** integration for better collaboration and visibility.

4. **Collaboration Features**: VZero has strong support for collaborative projects. You can share code snippets with others via markdown or comments in your UI.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Since VZero is built on React, it's already lightweight. For even smaller projects, you can just copy the UI without any CLI features.

Overall, while copy-pasting might feel clunky at first, VZero does save all the imports and placements through its internal mechanisms. Plus, the developer community support is always a plus if you need help troubleshooting or sharing ideas.

Let me know if you'd like more details about these aspects!
