Okay, so the user is talking about a series of tutorials they're working on for the Daily Grind. They started by using a tool called T, which is helpful for background tasks like AI look-ups or expensive AI projects. They mention that initially, there was nothing in their code, but after running the build, it added this feature with an "never enrich" setting.

The user then asks if I can review these tutorials and suggest improvements. They want to avoid breaking T and instead focus on teaching how they use the tool effectively. They also mention that some of their time spent was on diving into the AI prompting windows, which gave them a lot of experience but now wants to share this knowledge with others.

I should acknowledge the effort they've put in, especially focusing on best practices. I can suggest adding more examples or interactive tips where they could show other people how they use T's features. Maybe break down complex concepts into simpler steps and include hands-on exercises so people understand better.

Also, I need to make sure my feedback is constructive but not too harsh. They're doing a great job explaining their process, so I should encourage them to keep going with more content that builds on these tutorials.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts! It’s always cool when you can put aside time and effort into building something like this—knowing that it’s actually helping someone else understand and appreciate the tools they’re using. Let me know how I can assist further, whether it's by expanding on any of these ideas or offering more tips and tricks for T and other AI-related tools!
