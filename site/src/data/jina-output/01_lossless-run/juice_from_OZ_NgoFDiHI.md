Alright, let me try to work through how someone would respond after viewing this video. They probably saw the detailed instructions, tested out the agent, and found everything working as expected. They might be impressed by how quickly it could answer all their questions about Microsoft Teams, Copilot Studio, and the documents they use for HR.

Theyâ€™d probably start by thanking the person who made the video, maybe even mentioning a specific aspect like the auto attendant functionality or the differences between connectors and plugins. It would show they're actively using the product and finding it beneficial.

The user might then ask if there are any limitations or additional features they didn't know about, which could lead to more detailed questions in the future. Theyâ€™d also be curious about how this can scale for larger companies or maybe some real-world examples of their impact after seeing other usersâ€™ feedback.

After successfully sending an email, theyâ€™d probably look forward to hearing about how it's helping their team and any new features or changes they've implemented. It shows proactive use and a desire to help others by providing valuable insights.
