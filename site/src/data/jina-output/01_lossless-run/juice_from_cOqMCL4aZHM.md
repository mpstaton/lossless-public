Alright, the user has provided a detailed video tutorial from Peter McKinnon on using After Effects for space effects in their anatomy project. They want an explanation of how to use the toolbar and add text effects.

First, I'll identify the key points where he explains his process: navigating the toolbar with options like 3D Tracking, regular Tracking, Text Centering, etc., and then adding text effects using text boxes. He also touches on the timeline and composition window elements involved in timing.

I need to structure this explanation clearly, making sure each step is understandable. Maybe I'll break it down into numbered points for clarity. Highlighting specific tools like Text Centering and 3D Tracking with examples will make it more concrete.

The user also mentioned that if they're struggling or have issues, they should reach out through the message system. So I'll include a note about contacting Peter to get help or clarify any steps.

Finally, I'll ensure the tone is encouraging and supportive, letting them know there are additional resources like tutorials and meetings available for further assistance.

Great! Letâ€™s go through how you can use After Effects for space effects in your anatomy project and navigate the toolbar. If youâ€™re still having trouble, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for help or clarification.

### 1. **Understanding Your Toolbar**
   - The toolbar at the top of the After Effects window contains all the tools available in your library. These include:
     - **3D Tracking:** To follow objects and text during a shot.
     - **Regular Tracking:** To track text as it moves across the screen (right-click on the camera or click "Track Text" from the menu).
     - **Text Centering:** To center text vertically, which is useful for creating emphasis in your animation.
     - **3D Text Centering:** To position 3D objects and text relative to each other as they move.
   - The toolbar also includes a list of effects such as "Background," "Lightning," "Shadow," "Text Box," etc.

### 2. **Using the Toolbar**
   - Start by opening After Effects and navigating to your project folder in Composition Window (Window > Composition).
   - Once youâ€™re in your project, go to **Window > Tools** and select **Toolbox**.
   - Use the toolbar tools like "3D Tracking," "Regular Tracking," or "Text Centering" as needed.

### 3. **Adding Text Effects**
   - **Type a Text Box:** 
     - Go to **Window > Text Box** (Window > Text Box).
     - Select your text and click **OK**.
     - Use the toolbar tools to position, rotate, or scale the text box as needed.
   - **Use Text Centering:**
     - For 3D objects, select the object in **Window > Object** or use the camera controls (right-click on the camera).
     - Go to **Window > Text Centering** and adjust the positioning of your text relative to the object.

### 4. **Key Tools You Might Need**
   - **Text Centering:** Found under **Window > Text Centering**.
   - **3D Tracking:** Found under **Window > Camera Controls** or **Window > 3D Tracking**.
   - **Regular Tracking:** Under **Window > Regular Tracking**.

### 5. **Additional Tips**
   - **Timing Your Shot:** Use the Timeline window (Window > Timeline) to control your animation and ensure everything aligns correctly.
   - **Composition Window:** Use **Window > Composition** to set up multiple shots with text effects or for timing animations in a scene.
   - **Background and Lighting:** After you have all the text boxes, layer them together to create a background effect. You can also add lighting effects using tools like **Lightning**, **Shadow**, or **Textile Light**.
