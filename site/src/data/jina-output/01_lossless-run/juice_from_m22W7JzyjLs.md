Alright, I just saw this message. It looks like someone is talking about a chat UI interface they built called "Dennis." They're sharing some features and how they think their app can make conversations more engaging or easier for users. 

Hmm, I'm not familiar with Dennis, but it seems like they have a cool tool to help people communicate better. Let me try to understand what they might be doing here.

First, they mention multitasking AI with models like Meta's LLaMA. That makes sense because having multiple models can handle different tasks at the same time. Split screens are mentioned tooâ€”people probably want to work on two things simultaneously without missing a beat. They also talk about adding custom models using open router or eye compatibility, which I think is about connecting their app with other tools they might use.

Then, there's something about document files being automatically passed and content extracted for messages. That sounds like security measures, ensuring that users don't accidentally share sensitive information. The idea of saving files to a database is smart because it makes things easier for everyone involved.

Finally, the demo link suggests trying out the app with predefined prompts or supercharging conversations. They want to save time, so having prompts and ready-to-use options could be really helpful.

I'm thinking about how to respond here. Maybe I can summarize their ideas, highlight what they're doing well, and ask for more details if needed. It's important to show that they're doing something innovative without being overly technical. I should keep the tone friendly and open-ended so they feel comfortable sharing what they're working on.
