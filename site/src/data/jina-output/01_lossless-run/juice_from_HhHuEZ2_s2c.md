Alright, let's break down how I approached answering this user's query. The user provided a detailed scenario involving several different research tools—deep research, perplexity, and Google Workspace. They wanted me to explain my thought process as if I were talking to them.

First, I started by outlining the tools they mentioned: deep research from Gemini, perplexity for quick or lighter searches, and Google Workspace for their business needs. It's important to mention that each tool has its own strengths and uses best in certain contexts.

I then moved on to explain my approach when researching each tool. For deep research, I thought about the thoroughness required—looking at multiple sources and understanding complex trends. I compared perplexity with deep research highlighting that while perplexity is good for quick answers, deeper research provides more comprehensive insights which are crucial for strategic planning.

I also considered the pricing aspects: how much it costs for each tool. I realized Gemini was a better fit now since they've increased their price and offered additional services like AI models in Google Workspace. This shows an informed decision based on current needs.

Finally, I concluded by summarizing why these tools are beneficial—deep research for thorough strategic insights, perplexity for quick answers, and the flexibility of Google Workspace for business operations. I wanted to show that I understood each tool's unique strengths and how they contribute to effective marketing strategies and online Creator trends.
