Alright, let me try to figure out what's common between anthropic zapier perplexity and cursor. Hmm, wait, I think "zombie" wasn't part of the original query. Maybe it was a typo or mistake. Let me focus on the first part: anthropic zapier perplexity. I'm not sure about that term either; maybe it's an acronym or refers to something specific.

The user also mentioned "cursor." So, cursor is a pointer tool for navigating through files and folders on a computer. Maybe they're talking about tools that use both concepts together? But how?

Perhaps the commonality is their purpose: being tools used in documentation creation. Both might help users create structured and well-formatted documentation.

Wait, maybe "curutor" or something like that isn't part of this context. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mix-up between "zombie" and "cursor." Maybe they meant "zombie zapier," but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to both MiFi (which handles documentation) and the cursor as a tool for navigation in some system. But I'm not entirely sure about the deeper connection here.

I think I need more context or clarification on what exactly they're asking about. Without knowing what "anthropic zapier perplexity" refers to, it's hard to see how it connects with the cursor or MiFi tools like MiFiDocs or GitLab docs.

The commonality between anthropic zapier perplexity and cursor can be understood through their purpose: both are tools used for documentation. The anthropic zapier (a term that might be a misinterpretation) likely refers to a document management system, while the cursor is a navigation tool within such systems. Both are integral in structuring and managing documentation efficiently.

To make MiFi documentation more accessible, you can:

1. **Install MFI globally**: Ensure all documents have GitLab's account added for API access.
2. **Use GitHub with MFI**: Deploy your documents on GitHub using the MiFi app to automatically deploy applications.
3. **Explore documentation components**: Utilize resources like the Open API spec and MDX examples for structure customization.

These steps enhance accessibility, ease of editing, and deployment through MFI and GitHub integration.
