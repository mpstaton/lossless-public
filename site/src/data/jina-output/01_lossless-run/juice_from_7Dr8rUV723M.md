Okay, so I'm trying to understand Murray Campbell's perspective on the future of AI. He's a research scientist at IBM Research and is also the president of Triple AI. He talks about how significant advancements in AI over two years have changed everythingâ€”like more hardware focus, testing rather than design, working with non-ai people for research, and things like large language models.

He mentions that even people not in academia, like corporate employees, are involved in AI research now. That's a bit surprising but makes sense because AI is becoming more integrated into the real world where companies are investing more resources in their tech. He talks about the shift from planning to scheduling and constraint solving with planners, schedulers, and solvers.

He also points out that reasoning capabilities are emerging but aren't as rigid as before. These include things like meta-reasoning and other advanced AI techniques. So, there's a lot of potential here because reasoning can provide introspection and allow systems to self-verify their outputs, which is crucial for reliability.

The benefits he discusses go beyond just the current AI systems. They involve trust in AI, which is important for high-stakes decisions. Systems must be able to handle uncertainty, ethical considerations, and safety risks. He mentions agentic AI because it's about giving agency to AI systems, making them responsible and autonomous without human intervention.

He also brings up that reasoning isn't just a single thing but several interconnected areas. So, you can't just add more reasoning; you have to integrate it with other components or methods. This makes the field complex but potentially rewarding because combining different strengths of AI could lead to better systems.

As for the current state, he notes that while some systems are pretty good, they're too rigid and not adaptable enough for real-world complexity. He suggests there's still a lot work needed in areas like improving reasoning evaluation, integrating reasoning with other components, and developing more advanced meta-reasoning capabilities.

He also mentions the importance of collaboration between academia and industry because AI research needs to be both theoretically sound and practically applicable. This balance is crucial for AI to truly thrive.

In summary, Murray's vision includes advancing AI in hardware, moving towards testing, involving a broader range of people, focusing on reasoning, improving evaluation, integrating different AI components, building trust through reasoning, and fostering collaboration between sectors.

Murray Campbell sees the future of AI as one that emphasizes reasoning as a key component. Here's a structured overview based on his insights:

1. **Shift from Isolation to Integration**: The field is moving towards creating systems that can reason across diverse domains, integrating hardware advancements with practical applications.

2. **Rigorous Reasoning Capabilities**: Reasoning is not just about planning but includes meta-reasoning and advanced AI techniques, allowing systems to self-verify their outputs for accuracy and reliability.

3. **Trust in AI**: The integration of reasoning enhances trust through ethical considerations, safety assessments, and accountability (agentic AI), crucial for high-stakes decisions.

4. **Interconnected Areas**: Reasoning is a multifaceted area requiring collaboration with planning, scheduling, constraint solving, and other components to achieve comprehensive results.

5. **Future Directions**:
   - **Hardware Advancements**: Overcoming hardware limitations to ensure systems are reliable.
   - **Practical Applications**: Developing AI that can be used across industries for impactful solutions.
   - **Integration of Components**: Combining reasoning with machine learning, symbolic methods, and other AI techniques for better performance.

6. **Trust and Collaboration**: Ensuring AI systems are trustworthy through ethical standards and fostering cross-sector collaboration between academia and industry.

In essence, Murray's vision highlights the transformative potential of AI by elevating reasoning to a central theme, supported by rigorous development and practical application.
