Alright, let's break down how I approached creating the thought process for explaining Archon's features up to version 13.

First, I started by outlining what Archon was before version 13. This included its core functionalities like integrating with other tools, handling documentation, and providing a self-improvement loop. I made sure to highlight key features that set it apart from previous versions, such as advanced Vector databases and the local AI package.

Next, I moved on to version 12. Here, I focused on new features like document search reranking, hierarchical chunking, and query decomposition. These additions aimed to make Archon more efficient in handling complex workflows and improving its documentation management.

Then, for version 13, I introduced the mCP Marketplace integration, Lang Chain, a self-hosted Vector database, the local AI package, and advanced features like hybrid search reranking. This version emphasized Archon's versatility across different use cases and services.

Throughout this process, I made sure each version builds upon the previous one, adding new capabilities while retaining the core strengths of Archon. I also considered future plans to ensure the feature list is comprehensive and up-to-date as versions progress.
