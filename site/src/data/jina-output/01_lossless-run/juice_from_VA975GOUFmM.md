Okay, I'm trying to understand all these CSS features mentioned in the video. Let me go through each one by one.

First, "Last couple of years" is about a new feature called 'Recurrence' or something similar. From what I remember, it's related to dynamic content and maybe some animations. The user mentioned that if we just set a custom size for any element, it might override the styles but not sure exactly how that works.

Then there are features like 'Recurrence', 'Elastic', 'Responsive', 'Custom Positioning', 'Custom Alignments', and 'Custom Properties'. I think these are about positioning elements in different ways. For example, 'Recurrence' is for when you have a repeated element, maybe on hover or click. 'Elastic' sounds like it's related to animations where elements can stretch or shrink based on something.

'Shielded Areas' and 'Custom Colors' seem straightforwardâ€”setting colors and backgrounds where you want them. I guess this helps in creating cleaner interfaces.

Next is about containers being based on style variables. That makes sense, but I'm not exactly clear on how to use it yet. Maybe if you have a container with a specific style variable set, all elements inside will adjust accordingly.

Then 'Custom Containers' where instead of having fixed sizes, the size is determined by another property or an animation. This sounds like something you can do for any element in your design, making them responsive based on external factors.

'Visual Size Variables' and 'Visual Color Variables' are about using JavaScript variables to set styles. So if I have a variable like '$color' which holds the color code, I can use that inside my CSS to style an element.

'Quickly Changing Colors' is for when you want to change colors without having to type them in every time. Maybe by using a 'Visual Color Variables' table and selecting from it?

The 'Container' feature with both size and styles being dynamic sounds familiar. I think it's about applying styles based on the container's size, not just the size itself.

'Custom Containers' as mentioned earlier, but this might be similar to another point.

'Shielded Areas with Custom Sizes' is using a custom shielded area for content that doesn't show until certain conditions are met. That could be useful for non-functional requirements or placeholders.

'Dynamically Changing Colors and Sizes' seems like applying color and size based on variables in the DOM, which would make your design more dynamic and responsive.

The 'Interpolating Size Allow Keywords' feature is about animations where elements smoothly transition between sizes using calc properties. That's cool because it can add some visual flair without needing complex JavaScript.

Looking through all these points, I realize each one is a new layer in CSS functionality, allowing for more creative and dynamic designs. But since they're not widely supported yet, especially on older browsers like Chrome or Firefox, it might take time to see their full potential. Maybe if you start experimenting with them early on, you can unlock more features once the browser supports them.

I'm also thinking about how these features can be used together. For example, using 'Custom Positioning' and 'Visual Color Variables' could make an element responsive yet color-consistent in a design. Or combining 'Recurrence' effects with 'Elastic' animations for interactive elements would be a fun touch.

But I'm not entirely sure how all these features work together and if they can coexist without causing conflicts. It might require some careful testing to see if any of them interfere or override each other's styles. Overall, it looks like there are a lot of interesting ways to style elements dynamically in CSS, but their reach is limited by browser support.

The video explores several new CSS features that allow for dynamic and creative styling without relying on the browser itself, which can have limited support for these features. Here's a structured overview:

1. **Recurrence**: This feature allows dynamic content to appear at specific intervals (hover or click), providing animations like floating elements.

2. **Elastic Containers**: Elements within containers can stretch or shrink based on external factors, offering interactive and responsive designs.

3. **Responsive Container**: Elements can adjust their size based on the container's properties, making them adaptable to various contexts.

4. **Quickly Changing Colors**: Utilizes JavaScript variables like '$color' to set colors dynamically without manual input, enhancing design flexibility.

5. **Custom Containers**: Elements within custom containers have sizes determined by other properties or animations, allowing for responsive styles.

6. **Shielded Areas**: Content areas that don't appear unless a condition is met, useful for non-functional requirements.

7. **Quickly Changing Colors and Sizes**: Color and size are dynamically set based on variables in the DOM, adding interactivity to designs.

8. **Interpolating Size Allow Keywords**: Animates element heights using calc properties, achieving smooth transitions without complex JS.

These features enhance design flexibility but require careful experimentation due to limited browser support. Experimentation with these can unlock more potential and create visually engaging designs.
