Okay, so I just finished watching this video about Obsidian and how it's changing my life. Let me try to break it down and make sure I understand everything.

First off, the main idea is that instead of paying for premium services or taking notes by hand, which can be really expensive, you can use free templates on Obsidian. These templates are like tools or assets that let you create detailed notes without having to pay anything. That sounds awesome because it's saving me money and time.

I'm a bit confused about the different types of templates available. The video mentioned things like "Service," "Template," "Rumor," "NPC Organization," etc. I guess each one is for different purposes. For example, a "Service" template might be for recurring revenue or something that comes on a schedule, while a "_template" could be more about daily or weekly notes.

I'm also trying to figure out how the templates work. The video said you can set up and customize them without needing to code. That makes sense because I know some of my notes are getting cluttered with too many images and descriptions. Using a template seems like it would make managing them easier by applying consistent formatting and structures.

The part about using the view properties from Meta-Bain was new to me. I'm not sure how that works, but I think it's where you can customize text, bullets, and other elements in your notes. Maybe it's similar to word processing software where you can style each paragraph or section differently to make them look better.

I also noticed the mention of art types like "art text" and "art one." That sounds a bit technical, but I guess it refers to different ways you can format text for emphasis or clarity. For example, maybe "art text" could be for bullet points that stand out in your list of ideas.

The video talked about customizing the look of these templates and how much freedom there is with the styling options. It makes me think Obsidian should have a lot more customization tools than I realize. I wonder if it's similar to Google Docs or some other word processing software in terms of formatting flexibility.

Another thing that caught my eye was the mention of view properties from Meta-Bain. I'm not exactly sure what Meta-Bain is, but since it's mentioned alongside view properties, maybe it's a tool within Obsidian or part of it. It probably allows for more advanced customization beyond just basic text styling.

I'm also thinking about how this fits into my current setup. Do I have templates set up on Obsidian? If so, where can I find them and how should I start using them effectively? Maybe there are tutorials or guides that explain how to customize your existing templates further. I'm excited to try this out because it sounds like a game-changer for saving money and keeping my notes organized.

Overall, I feel like Obsidian is a powerful tool that's making note-taking much easier than I thought. It's not just about taking notes anymore; it's about having professional-looking and well-organized documents that can be shared or used in various ways. I'm definitely going to give it a try and see how my notes look after switching from traditional methods.
