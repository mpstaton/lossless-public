Okay, so the user is back after watching this video. They want to explain themselves better using After Effects, specifically in the Composition Window and Text Effects. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, they mentioned their camera or phone device. I should make it clear that they can use any device with an iPhone or Android app. Maybe suggest using a specific model if possible, but since they're free to choose, just mention the availability.

They used After Effects for Text Effects, so I should highlight that process again. Show how they created text effects and where they applied them in their project. This will help them understand practical applications.

Then, I need to talk about using Text Effects in Composition Window. I'll outline the steps: selecting the Composition Window, adding a frame, then inserting text. Emphasize how this allows for more dynamic content without using text effects in other windows.

I should also mention using Text Effects from Compose Window again, so they know it's consistent across their project. Maybe show an example of that to make it clear.

Next, I'll talk about Positioning Text in timeline. I remember the user mentioned using 3D Tracking and regular tracking. So, explain how text positioning works: 3D Tracking places objects into the scene, while Regular Tracking targets specific points.

I need to make sure they know when to use which method. Maybe give a quick example of each so it's clear when to apply them in their project.

After that, I should touch on Text Effects from Compose Window again, maybe go through a few more examples to reinforce the concept.

Finally, wrap up with tips for success: using the right tools, keeping it concise, and checking your work. Maybe add something about saving the file before compressing to prevent errors.

I think that covers all the key points. I'll make sure each section is clear and broken down into steps so it's easy to follow. Also, remember to use emojis where appropriate for engagement.

Alright! Letâ€™s continue with your video explanation using After Effects. Here are some key points you can cover in the Composition Window and Text Effects:

---

### **1. Using Text Effects in the Composition Window**
- When working in the **Composition Window**, text effects can be used to create more dynamic content without using text tools elsewhere.
- To use text effects:
  - Select **Insert Text** (or go to **Effect â†’ Text Effect**).
  - A frame will appear with a placeholder where youâ€™ll place your text.
  - Use your deviceâ€™s camera or phone app to take a picture of the scene and position your text.
  - Apply After Effects effects like shadows, highlights, blur, or scale to enhance the text.

---

### **2. Positioning Text in Your Timeline**
- You can use **3D Tracking** (on devices with 3D support) or **Regular Tracking** for text positioning:
  - When tracking a scene, place your camera/camphone at a point of interest.
    - For example, if youâ€™re shooting a scene from the front, position the device so that one of your body parts is in view (e.g., eye contact).
    - This will allow After Effects to place text where your body is in the scene.
  - Use **Regular Tracking** for static objects or specific points:
    - Place multiple cameras/camphone pieces on a chair, position them in different areas of the scene, and track the object.

---

### **3. Text Effects from Compose Window**
- If you want to add text effects (like shadows, highlights, blur) to your scene during timeline creation:
  - After inserting text into the composition window, right-click on the frame and select **Effect â†’ Text Effect**.
  - Youâ€™ll have access to various After Effects effects for the text.

---

### **4. Tips for Success**
- Always start by using the right tools (e.g., Before/After Effects) in your project.
- Keep your text concise and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Save your file before compressing it to ensure no data loss during compression.
