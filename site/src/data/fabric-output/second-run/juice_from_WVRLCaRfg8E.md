Alright, I'm looking at this user's question and trying to understand what they're asking for. They start by greeting me, then go on to describe a series of code blocks with specific styling using Prism.js themes. They mention that these are lit components and how it's better than React because it's lightweight. They also show some code snippets with the 'copy' button pointing to a custom CSS class.

Hmm, I see they're talking about setting up an Astro starter project. Let me break down their specific questions:

1. **Copy Button in Prism**: The user wants to know why the copy button is set to white and how to adjust it. From what I remember, Prism's default style might just have a light color, so it's hard to see. They can add some CSS to change the color class.

2. **Lit Component Issue**: They're confused about using lit components because they don't work in all views or if the code isn't passing through. Maybe I should suggest checking the layout and theme options before adding lit.

3. **Copy Button Functionality**: They want to know how to use the copy button correctly. I should explain that you can right-click, select 'copy', then paste into your browser.

4. **Linking Lit Components**: They're unsure about loading lit components from JavaScript files. I'll need to clarify that they just have to add the script tag and it should load without any issues.

5. **Best Practices for Updates**: Since their code isn't passing through, maybe adding a React Router or other dependencies would help with routing and navigation in future posts.

6. **Future Improvements**: They want suggestions to make their project better. Maybe improving readability, using more themes, enhancing interactivity, adding context menus, etc.

I should organize these thoughts into clear points for the user to understand each part of their setup. Make sure I address each question with a concise answer and offer further help if they have more questions.

It seems like you're working on an Astro starter project. Let me break down your questions:

### 1. **Why is the copy button white?**
The custom CSS class under the `<div>` tag might just be a light color for styling purposes, so to make it visible in Prism's theme, you can adjust the `copy` color by adding some CSS.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/prism@latest/dist/prism.min.js"></script>
<style>
#copy-class {
  color: white;
}
</style>
```

### 2. **How to use lit components?**
Lit components are lightweight and work well for your project. To ensure they pass through:

- Make sure you have a layout set up (e.g., blog post layout).
- Add the `astro.resolve` package by running:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @types/prism @types/astro
  ```
- Then, use a lit component in your code block with:
  ```typescript
  <astro.resolve<ComponentName>.src>
    /* your JavaScript here */
  </astro.resolve>
  ```

### 3. **What's the issue with loading lit components?**
Lit components are lightweight and will load quickly regardless of how much you use them, so they should work without issues.

### 4. **How to copy a custom CSS class?**
Right-click on the Prism component where the button is located (e.g., in your blog post), select "Copy," then paste it into your browser's developer tools or use the browser's copy function.

```bash
# Right click and copy the Prism element (the div)
# Then paste directly into your browser:
<Prism-SingleColorChecker color="white" id="copy-color" />
```

### 5. **Future improvements for this project:**
Here are a few suggestions to make your project better:

- **Improve readability:** Use more consistent naming conventions and structure your code.
- **Use a theme:** Prism.js is a great choice, but you can also use other themes like Lightweight or Space.
- **Enhance interactivity:** Add event handling for the copy button's functionality so that it works across different projects.
- **Add context menu support:** Use React Router to add context menus in your next blog post.
- **Improve routing:** If your project has multiple views, use components like `astro.Routing` to make navigation easier.

Would you like me to explain any of these points further?
