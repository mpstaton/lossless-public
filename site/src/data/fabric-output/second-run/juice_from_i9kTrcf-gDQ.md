Okay, so Ray Fernando is talking about a tool called DeepSeek, which uses prompting and reasoning models. He mentions some services like Gro, Run2Run, and DeepSeek's Play. He also talks about data privacy, using encrypted URLs and the Apollo app. He gives an example of how to use a model in Run2Run for text-to-speech, which is cool. Then he introduces Ray's YouTube channel, "Ray Fernando 1337," encouraging viewers to subscribe and comment. He ends with a call to action: take it easy, don't be left behind; explore this intelligence and share your projects. 

Hmm, I want to make sure I understand everything Ray is saying here. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, DeepSeek's DeepSeek app on Gro. I know DeepSeek is a cloud-based AI platform. The DeepSeek app seems to integrate with other services like Run2Run and Apollo. That makes sense because it should allow users to run tasks from Run2Run directly to DeepSeek for faster processing. 

Then, talking about data privacy. He says they encrypt URLs so that data isn't exposed. That's important because it protects user information. Using encrypted URLs is a standard practice in AI security, but Ray mentions this as something specific to DeepSeek.

Next, he talks about Run2Run and how you can run text-to-speech tasks directly from Run2Run. I think Run2Run allows for various AI tasks like summarization, translation, etc., which are then sent to DeepSeek for faster processing. That would make tasks quicker and more efficient, especially if the user is handling something that needs a lot of processing power.

Ray mentions the Apollo app and how it's a paid tool but worth exploring. He calls it "deepseek.com" but emphasizes that it's free for users. So, even though it's a paid service, Ray encourages people to check out its features because sometimes there might be discounts or free trials available.

He also introduces his YouTube channel, "Ray Fernando 1337," which is called "1337." That sounds like a catchy name, maybe after the 0.1337 algorithm in DeepSeek? It's meant to engage viewers and keep them coming back for more content.

In the example of how to use Run2Run for text-to-speech, Ray shows how to access the text-to-speech task from Run2Run, set parameters like speed and duration, then run it through DeepSeek. This is a step-by-step guide that should be helpful for anyone looking to use this feature.

Then, he gives an example of generating an image using DeepSeek's Play app. He shows how to open the model, input text, and get the output in one go. Thatâ€™s useful because sometimes tasks are too big or complex to handle manually.

He also mentions the current state of AI development, highlighting that while things are advancing rapidly, we're still learning. Ray is part of an organization called DeepSeek, which is focused on creating tools that help users access this intelligence more easily and share their projects.

In his conclusion, he encourages viewers to take it easy, don't be left behind, explore the opportunities AI offers, and engage with the community by sharing their work. He ends with a call to action: "Take it easy, thanks [Music]"

I think I got all the main points, but maybe I missed something about how DeepSeek integrates with Run2Run or the specifics of data encryption. Also, he mentions the Apollo app being free, so that's a good point for people to consider.

Overall, Ray is providing a comprehensive guide on using DeepSeek and its tools like Gro and Run2Run, while also introducing his channel. I should make sure each part flows smoothly and covers all these elements clearly.
