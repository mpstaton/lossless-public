Okay, so the user has shared some videos about Obsidian and how it's used as a Markdown editor. They're interested in learning more about using it as both an editor and a documentation tool. From the videos, they can tell they found it helpful for taking notes on the go.

First, I should acknowledge their enthusiasm and appreciation for the resources. Then, delve deeper into each feature they mentioned. For example, when discussing search and daily notes, I want to explain how these can be used together for efficient note organization. Maybe suggest organizing individual entries with keywords or tags.

Next, looking at the Advanced Table Plug-in makes me think about how it enhances table creation in Markdown, especially for structured data. I should highlight key features like sorting, alignment, and pivot without getting too technical.

The Pinner feature is a nice touch because it ties notes directly to specific days, which can be useful for reminders or deadlines. It's good to mention that even if you don't use it every day, having it on your shelf helps with organization.

Overall, the user seems interested in practical applications beyond just using Markdown. They probably want tools that help them stay organized and efficient both at home and at work. I should encourage them to explore more tools available for documentation as well.

Absolutely! It’s great that you’re looking for ways to use Obsidian (or whatever version you’re using) for both writing and documenting. Here are some key features to highlight:

### 1. **Search Function**
   - Obsidian has an excellent search feature built into it, which allows you to look up your notes instantly. It can find specific words, phrases, or even entire entries.
   - You can also use the search function with tags, keywords, or even markdown syntax to make your searches more precise.

### 2. **Daily Notes and To-Do Lists**
   - Obsidian has a daily note pinner that helps you keep track of tasks and deadlines. When you look at your today’s note, it highlights three to-dos that haven’t been checked yet.
   - You can also add reminders or links to the notes so they stay visible even after you’ve closed them.

### 3. **Advanced Table Plug-in**
   - If you need more advanced table formatting, Obsidian offers a plug-in called the **Advanced Table Plug-in** for markdown. This allows you to create tables with markdown support and format your entries in ways similar to Word or Google Sheets.
   - You can also use this plug-in to create pivot tables, conditional formatting, and other visualizations that make working with data easier.

### 4. **Markdown Documentation**
   - While Markdown isn’t typically associated with documentation, Obsidian allows you to use markdown for writing descriptions or instructions. It’s a great way to document your thoughts and ideas in a format you’re already familiar with.
   - You can also use other tools alongside markdown for more complex documentation needs.

### 5. **Pinner Feature**
   - If you want persistence of notes across multiple platforms, Obsidian offers a **pinner** feature that ties notes directly to specific days or events. This makes it easier to organize and track your notes if you’re working on a project with recurring deadlines.

If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask! Let’s keep exploring how you can use Obsidian as both a writer and a documentator tool.
