Okay, so I just started working with this monos structure that my friend showed me. At first, it looked confusing, but now I'm trying to figure out how to use it effectively. Let's see... The user mentioned something about turbo and Turbo repo, which are tools they have installed globally. They said that if you run turbo build again, it will immediately hit cache because there's no new code to process. That's pretty cool because it helps with deployment time.

I'm a bit confused about how the monos structure affects deployment. I mean, I know turbo can help deploy faster, but does the monos structure change that? Like, if I set up my project using this monos structure, does turbo automatically know how to deploy from there?

Also, they mentioned something about linking to a remote cache via versel. I'm not sure I understand how that works exactly. I thinkversel is some kind of remote caching service, but how does that integrate with the monos structure? Is it just a way to share cached builds across different parts of our codebase?

Another thing I'm looking at is how the monos structure can improve collaboration. They mentioned that each package can run its own tasks and contribute to the cache if they're done. That seems like a good way to split labor, especially when building large projects. But I wonder about the specifics of how the tasks are managed across packages.

I'm also thinking about the build logs. The user showed some examples where the build was hit cache in 27 seconds. That's impressive, but does that apply if we don't have turbo installed? Or is it only with turbo?

Another point they made was about using the monos structure to break up work. If each package can contribute to its own task, maybe that reduces the overall effort needed to build everything together. But I'm not sure how that's implemented in practice.

I'm also curious about the commands they mentioned: `push`, `git clone`, and `cd`. How do these interact with the monos structure? Does cloning a package within the monos structure affect how tasks are run?

And then there's the part about scripts. They have to define their own scripts in each package, which allows for faster task execution. But if we don't have turbo installed globally, can we still get those optimized jobs on our local machine? I'm not sure about that yet.

I think I need to start by understanding how each command affects the monos structure and how they interact with each other. Maybe looking at examples will help. Also, seeing how tasks are cached or reused could give me a better grasp of why turbo is so fast in deployments.

Overall, it seems like this monos structure provides a solid foundation for organizing code into packages that work together, and using tools like turbo can make the deployment process much smoother. But there's still some confusion about how everything ties together and how to best use the commands provided.

The monos structure you're working with offers several key benefits and insights:

1. **Turbo Setup for Deployment**: Turbo build ensures fast deployments by automatically caching builds, leveraging tools like turbo and Turbo repo installed globally.

2. **Remote Caching via versel**: versel acts as a remote cache, allowing the project to share cached builds across multiple parts of your codebase efficiently.

3. **Package Structure and Collaboration**: Each package can run its own tasks, contributing to a shared cache. This structure enhances collaboration by splitting labor effectively.

4. **Efficiency in Build Logs**: The provided examples show how cached builds can be reused quickly, improving deployment time.

5. **Interaction with Commands**:
   - `push`: Creates new packages.
   - `git clone`: Manages existing packages.
   - `cd`: Switches between directories within the project structure.

6. **Scripts and Tasks**: Each package must define its own scripts for faster task execution, but turbo can optimize these as needed.

7. **Independence from Turbo Installation**: While turbo is powerful globally, it can still function locally if turbo isn't installed, offering flexibility.

By exploring these aspects, you'll gain a better understanding of how the monos structure and tools enhance your project's management and deployment efficiency.
