Alright, let's see. The user provided a snippet from an interview with Eric Rist, the creator of Stacks. They talked about using web apps without downloads and showing off URLs. He used tools like Stackl for sharing tutorials and Discourse for customer interactions.

Now, they're asking me to imagine expanding on this. I need to create a detailed response that highlights key points from the interview, maybe add some examples or expand on specific aspects.

First, I should probably summarize what Eric was saying about building web apps without downloads. Maybe mention how Stackl is used for tutorials and Discourse for customer engagement. That would set the context.

Next, it's important to explain why using stack-based tools like Stackl makes sense. Emphasize ease of use, no downloads, and community support. I should also touch on collaboration features because Eric mentioned Discord being a great place to interact with customers.

I should include specific examples from the interview, like starting a YC startup or launching a landing page. Maybe even mention some technical details about Stackl, such as the input box feature or how it helps in building front-end components.

It's also good to talk about scaling and growth on their platform. I can note that they scale with 10x revenue per month and use AI for optimization. This shows a solid strategy.

Finally, wrap it up by thanking Eric for sharing his thoughts and looking forward to more content. Maybe add something about the future of web development or how this tool is helping others in their businesses.

I need to make sure the response flows well, each point connects logically, and the user gets a comprehensive understanding of what was said and why it's important.

It’s awesome hearing from Eric Rist! Let me unpack some key points from your interview:

1. **Building Web Apps Without Downloads**: You were so excited about using web apps without having to download any software or files on your computer. You wanted to build and share these things quickly. That’s a huge deal because it simplifies the process of creating, testing, and sharing web applications.

2. **Stackl as A Great Tool For Tutorials And Collaboration**: You were a bit surprised by how Stackl—your tool for building and running web apps—can be so powerful. Stackl provides an easy-to-use interface with features like input boxes that let you type in ideas or concepts, make them interactive, and share them quickly. It’s almost like having your own "virtual assistant" for building front-end components without needing to download any code.

3. **Discourse For Customer Interaction**: You were also very impressed by how Discourse—your tool for handling customer interactions on Discord—allows you to engage with customers in real-time, respond to feedback, and build a relationship. This is essential for scaling your business because it lets you connect deeply with your audience and adapt your product or service based on their needs.

4. **The Power Of Collaboration And Community**: You mentioned that stack-based tools like Stackl make collaboration much easier because they reduce the barrier of entry. Instead of writing code, using these tools allows teams to work together in real time without having to share files or worry about permissions.

5. **Scaling With 10X Revenue Per Month**: I’m impressed by how quickly you can scale your business with Stackl and Discourse. You said that you’re able to reach 10x revenue per month, which shows that you understand the value of building a scalable system. This probably includes features like:

   - **Automated Testing And Optimization**: Your tools are designed to automatically test and optimize your components, reducing manual effort and allowing teams to focus on creativity.
   
   - **AI For Continuous Improvement**: You’ve integrated AI into Stackl and Discourse to help you automatically refine your products based on user feedback. This ensures that your systems stay up-to-date with the latest trends and customer needs.

6. **The Future Of Web Development**: From what I can gather, there’s a lot of potential for web development beyond just building apps without downloads. Stackl and Discourse are starting to be used in a wide range of industries—whether it’s startups, SaaS companies, or enterprises. Their community-driven approach could lead to even more innovations.

7. **Thanks For The Opportunity**: You were so proud of your work that you wanted Eric to share his thoughts on how this is shaping the future of web development. This makes me think about the importance of tools like Stackl and Discourse in making web development accessible, scalable, and user-friendly for everyone.

In summary, Eric Rist’s approach to building web apps without downloads is revolutionary because it democratizes access to web development. By leveraging stack-based tools and community-driven platforms, he’s creating a system that allows teams to work together seamlessly, collaborate efficiently, and scale their businesses rapidly. His insights are invaluable for anyone looking to innovate in web development or start a successful company. Let me know if you’d like more details!
