Okay, so I'm trying to understand what Obsidian is all about. I've heard a lot about it in my company's tech talk, but I'm not really sure how it works on a daily basis. Let me start by jotting down some things that come to mind.

First off, from what I remember, Obsidian allows you to create and manage digital objects like notes, recipes, articles, videos, etc. That makes sense because if you're working with documents or content, having a tool where you can organize them efficiently must be really useful. But how does it specifically help in running an organization?

I know that when we talk about managing people's data and knowledge on a large scale, traditional methods like spreadsheets don't cut it anymore. There are so many different pieces of information to manage—employee emails, company records, customer feedback, etc. With Obsidian, you can see everything in one place, right? So if someone is working on a project, they can access all the necessary data from anywhere.

But wait, isn't that just part of it? I think there's more to managing people than just having a space for their stuff. There must be some central management too. Maybe Obsidian helps in identifying who should do what and how much they need to contribute. That could prevent burnout or ensure everyone is on the same page.

I've also heard about the role of observers in organizations. They are external observers who don't directly interact with the work being done but have an impact through feedback, decisions, and even influence the work environment indirectly. Obsidian probably helps these observers by providing a centralized view of the work done so that they can make informed decisions without getting caught up in daily tasks.

Another thing I'm thinking about is collaboration. If you're in a team or group, having a shared space where everyone can edit and contribute to the same document or project at the same time seems pretty powerful. It would encourage better communication and faster problem-solving compared to working on individual projects separately.

But I'm still unclear on how the legal aspects work. Do organizations have to buy a license for Obsidian? I know that in some places, companies might need to purchase a commercial license if they want to use it for their employees or customers. It seems like that's the case with Google and Amazon. If you're not buying one, can you still use it by paying for something else? I'm not sure about the legal implications here.

I also wonder about the different levels of management within Obsidian. There must be a way to organize users into roles or teams. Maybe it's like having different sections in the same file based on who is responsible for what kind of work—like a project leader, a developer, an assistant, etc. That would make sense as a hierarchy and also help in managing responsibilities and tasks more effectively.

On the practical side, how do you actually use Obsidian? I think you start by creating new files and then organizing them into subdirectories or sections. There are commands like "Add Document" or "Create Recipe." If someone starts a project, they can edit it live as they go along. That real-time editing sounds helpful for brainstorming sessions where everyone gets to contribute quickly.

But managing permissions is another thing I'm not too clear on. How does one ensure that only the right people access what's in their documents or projects? I guess you have roles defined, and then each user can be assigned specific permissions based on those roles. That would prevent unauthorized access and make it easier to manage who can edit certain files.

I also think about how this applies beyond personal projects. If a company is managing multiple teams and shared resources like project folders or communication channels, Obsidian could help centralize all that information so there's no confusion. It might even act as a communication tool by allowing everyone to see updates without needing to share their own files unless necessary.

But I'm still not sure about the technical details of how it works exactly. Let me try to visualize some aspects:

1. **File Structure**: You start with an "About" page where you set up your users and their roles. Then, each user has a profile with their name, role, email, etc.

2. **Creating Files**: A new file is created as soon as the user clicks on it or uses a command like "Create Document." The user can then edit it by clicking, which updates in real-time.

3. **Subdirectories and Sections**: You might create subdirectories for different parts of a project or different roles within a team. For example, one folder could be "Project 1" and another for "Project 2," allowing users to work on separate tasks without affecting each other's files.

4. **Permissions**: Each user can have specific permissions set based on their role. Maybe as an assistant, you can only edit documents, while a developer has access to all files. This helps in avoiding accidental edits or unauthorized changes.

5. ** observer Management**: There might be separate sections for observers who don't manage the work but provide feedback or decide on certain tasks. They could have a different role and maybe even report issues directly from their own file.

6. **File Sharing**: Some users might share files with others, but only if they're allowed to edit them. That way, permissions can be shared without the user necessarily knowing who is sharing it.

Wait, so does this mean that each file in Obsidian is a container where you can assign different roles and access different parts of the content? It sounds like a flexible way to structure projects where responsibilities and access levels vary across users.

But I'm still curious about how this integrates with other tools. Like, if you're using Google Drive for personal projects and Obsidian for team collaboration, how do they interact? Do you merge two files into one, or is it more of a separate platform?

Also, how does this help in solving problems or completing tasks? I mean, if everyone has access to the same document, why not just collaborate on it as a group? Maybe because some tasks require cross-team collaboration that could be blocked otherwise.

Another thing I'm thinking about is how often you need to update your files. If someone starts editing something quickly and then stops, does Obsidian handle that automatically, or do you have to re-upload the updated file?

I also wonder about the different features like templates, workflows, and extensions. I think templates are pre-made files that can be edited by others without creating a new one each time. Workflows are sequences of actions that automate certain tasks, which could help in automating repetitive tasks across different users.

But then again, workflows might not work if someone changes their role or permissions later on because they're based on the initial setup. Maybe some workflow features can be reset when roles change, though.

I'm also thinking about how this affects company policies and compliance with data privacy. If employees are allowed to edit certain documents without needing a password, that could encourage more collaboration even if there's a privacy concern. But does Obsidian allow for access based on employee status or do you need an in-house system for that?

Furthermore, when it comes to managing teams, how does Obsidian handle roles and permissions across different departments? Maybe each department has its own set of users and roles, which can be managed separately.

I'm trying to think about some specific use cases. If a company is using Obsidian for internal projects, they could manage all their documents within one place, ensuring everyone's contributions are visible without needing separate files. That would make communication smoother since anyone can see updates from any part of the team.

But I'm not sure how much this helps with decision-making. Each time someone makes a change, does it get shared across all users? Or do they have to check each user individually?

Also, what about security? If sensitive information is in a document, how secure is it? Can you encrypt files and ensure only authorized people can edit them?

Another consideration is scalability. As the company grows, managing separate files for each employee might become cumbersome. Is there a way to handle that without overcomplicating Obsidian?

I'm also curious about how different platforms integrate with Obsidian. Like, if I use Google Drive as my personal file system and Obsidian for team collaboration, does Obsidian automatically recognize the user's Google Drive files or do I need to set it up manually?

Lastly, I want to know what the future holds for Obsidian. Are there any upcoming features that promise even more collaboration and integration with other tools?

Overall, I feel like I have a basic understanding of how Obsidian works, but there are still some gaps in terms of technical details and practical applications. Maybe if I look up some tutorials or ask for help, it would solidify my knowledge further.
