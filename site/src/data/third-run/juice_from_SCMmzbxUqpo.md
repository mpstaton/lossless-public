Okay, so I just finished watching this video about Zen Browser. It's a pretty interesting browser that's new but looks super cool. Let me try to figure out what I learned here.

First off, the main features mentioned were the URL bar and the rich text editor. The URL bar is kind of like Firefox but bigger, which probably makes sense because it's aimed at web users. The Rich Text Editor is a big deal because it's not just text; you can add images, links to Wikipedia articles, and even markdown notes. That sounds really useful for writing longer posts or sharing content. I guess that means Zen Browser is more than just a browser—it's a comprehensive tool.

I noticed there are some customization options like tabs and extensions. Tabs let you organize your pages easily by clicking on them. Extensions can do cool things like filtering ads, reading articles from different languages, etc. That makes sense because most browsers have extensions to add functionality beyond their basic features.

The video also talked about its browser history—starting with Firefox before they merged it into Zen Browser. That's a bit old-school for a modern browser but maybe the team is building on that legacy now. I'm curious how they're keeping the user experience fresh while bringing back old features.

One thing I was confused about is why Web Search isn't in the Rich Text Editor. It’s something you’d expect since it's part of Google’s search bar, but I guess Zen Browser does it through their own plugin or extension to keep things separate from Google's browser. That makes sense because otherwise, if someone types "search" into a page, they might accidentally open something else.

Another point was the URL bar having both 'http' and 'https' options. I think that’s to let you choose between the two protocols when entering URLs. I wonder how this affects things like HTTPS websites. Maybe it's just one of many options for users who don't want to type out the full protocol, saving them time.

The video also talked about using the preview feature with Alt and Shift keys. This is super handy because it gives real-time previews before clicking on links or files. It helps prevent accidental clicks that might lead to security issues or unexpected behavior. I can see how this would reduce errors and save time.

I’m also thinking about how this browser could integrate with other tools. The mention of Firefox extensions suggests that Zen Browser is built on top of a common platform, which makes it easier to add plugins. Maybe they have some partnerships or integrations with other tools like Google Drive or GitHub, though I haven’t heard much yet.

The video mentioned the importance of having a minimal team but building on an existing foundation. It’s cool how they’re trying to keep the user experience fresh without losing the core browser features. Plus, it's pretty open-source, so anyone can contribute, which is always a plus for the community.

Overall, Zen Browser seems like a modern take on a classic browser with a lot of promise. I’m excited to try it out and see how it stacks up against other browsers in the future.
