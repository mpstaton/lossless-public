Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this task page as described. Let me start by breaking down the steps outlined.

First, on the source tables page, we need to go into the databases folder. Under that, there are two options: hide otherwise or rename it. Since the document is being created without a paid plan, I'll just rename it to something like "Source Tables" and keep it hidden for now.

Next, under each database folder, there's an option to copy everything from another source, but since we're starting fresh, maybe that's not necessary unless we need data from another source. Then, clicking on the "Create table view" button will set up a new table structure. Looking at the options here, I think setting it up with tables and dependencies makes sense because tasks depend on each other.

In the tables section, adding two columns: one for task name and description, and another for depends on (which is the dependency column we need to create). The "Create table view" button should generate this based on our data. I'll have to make sure that all dependencies are correctly added so tasks reference each other accurately.

Then, under "Display" settings, clicking "Show dependencies" will ensure that when tasks are dragged onto a timeline, they automatically show their dependencies. That seems essential for understanding the workflow structure.

Looking at the formatting options, making sure the labels are correct and the text is clear is important so future users can easily find what they're looking for.

Finally, setting up the initial tasks with links from other pages makes sense to show that tasks are based on other resources or previous steps. This adds value and helps in understanding where each task comes from.

Overall, it's a structured way to organize the data using tables and dependencies while maintaining accessibility through various views like the timeline and cards. I think this approach will make future updates and queries more organized without missing any links.

To create the task page as described, follow these organized steps:

1. **Access the Source Tables Folder:**
   - Go to the "Source Tables" page in the navigation bar.

2. **Rename the Database:**
   - Under "Databases," rename the database folder to "Source Tables."

3. **Create a Table View:**
   - Click on "Create table view" under "Data Sources."
   - Set up your tables and dependencies:
     - Create two columns: one for task name and description, and another for the "depends on" column.
     - Use the "Set relationships with dependencies" option to define how tasks reference each other.

4. **Display Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the "Display dependencies" section and click "Show dependencies." This ensures that all links show their dependencies when dragging onto a timeline.

5. **Formatting and Labels:**
   - Review the table labels and descriptions for accuracy.
   - Ensure text is clear and properly formatted so future users can easily find what they're looking for.

6. **Display Initial Tasks:**
   - Add initial tasks with relevant links, showing dependencies to ensure workflow integrity.

7. **Finalize the Setup:**
   - Once satisfied, go back to the "Task" page.
   - Navigate to your desired view (cards, timeline, etc.) and set up formatting for visibility and ease of use.

This approach organizes data into a structured format while maintaining accessibility through multiple views, ensuring future updates are well organized without missing links.
