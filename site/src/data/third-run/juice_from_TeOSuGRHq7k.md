Okay, so I'm trying to follow along with the video about monos. Let me try to break it down step by step because I don't fully understand all of it yet.

First, the video starts talking about monos and how they are similar to monads or async/await in JavaScript. It seems like monos is a way to structure code that's more functional. Monads are something I've heard before, but I'm not exactly sure what they do. From what I remember, monads are part of the functors and traversables in JavaScript, used for sequencing operations.

The video explains that monos provide a way to write code that's similar to async/await, which helps in managing asynchronous tasks more cleanly. They also mention that monos have certain rules or patterns that you can follow when writing your code. That makes me think about how functional programming works and if monos are just rephrasing those concepts.

I'm a bit confused about the differences between async/await and monos. I know async/await is more traditional JavaScript, while monos might be based on TypeScript or a type of language like TypeScript. The video doesn't mention any TypeScript stuff though, so maybe it's talking about standard JavaScript syntax but using monos to structure it.

The example given in the video is with Turbo build. It runs builds very quickly because of these structures. I'm not familiar with Turbo build, but from what I know, it's a JavaScript module that allows for async file reading and writing. If it can run builds so fast, maybe they're using monos to optimize how it works.

The video talks about the structure like root, docs, turbo, and verel. Each of these is part of the repository tree. Root has apps, docs, turbo, and then versel which connects everything. That makes sense because having a clear structure helps in managing dependencies and ensures that all parts are up to date.

I'm a bit worried about how monos handle errors. The video says they're designed with error handling in mind. Maybe when working with monos, you can use try-catch blocks or hooks like error. But I don't know the specific syntax for that yet.

Another thing I'm unclear on is how the module system works. It mentions that modules are part of functors and traversables but I don't really get what a functor or a traversal is in this context. Maybe it's something to do with functions that take one argument and produce a value, like functions that return another function.

The video also talks about using monos for building tasks. It says that Turbo can run builds very quickly because of the structures you set up, which makes sense because each module is isolated but still accessible through the repository tree. I think this would help in scenarios where you have multiple applications or projects that need to be built simultaneously.

I'm wondering if there are limitations to monos as a tool. For instance, can it handle very large or complex modules? Or are there cases where using monos isn't better than standard JavaScript methods?

Also, I'm not sure how the TypeScript type system fits into this. The video doesn't mention anything about that, so maybe that's something I'll look into later. Understanding TypeScript would help me see how monos interact with other parts of my codebase.

I think I need to go through each point step by step and make a list or write down what I understand. Maybe starting from the basics: what are monads? How do they relate to async/await? Then moving on to monos and their structure, followed by how they're used with Turbo build, the repository tree, functors and traversables, error handling, and limitations.

I'm going to try to outline each section I understand so I can see where my knowledge is and what's still unclear. That way, if there are parts that don't make sense, I can revisit them later or ask for clarification.

To provide a clear understanding of the video on monos, here's an organized summary:

1. **Introduction to Monads in JavaScript**: Monads are part of the functors and traversables in JavaScript, designed for sequencing operations with effects like error handling.

2. **Async/Aways vs Monos**: While async/await is traditional JavaScript, monos offer a structured approach that leverages these concepts but integrates them into TypeScript or another language framework.

3. **Turbo Build's Efficiency**: Turbo build uses monos to optimize build tasks by running builds quickly through structured modules and caching mechanisms.

4. **Repository Structure**: Monos define a repository tree with root, apps, docs, turbo, and versel, ensuring clear dependencies and easy updates.

5. **Monads and Functors/Traversables**: Monads are functors that turn values into chains of operations, handling side effects gracefully.

6. **Error Handling in Monos**: While specifics aren't detailed, monos likely support error handling via try-catch blocks or hooks like error.

7. **Type System Considerations**: TypeScript is mentioned but not fully explored. Understanding it could enhance interaction with other modules.

8. **Limitations and Considerations**: Potential challenges include scalability for large or complex modules and the need for learning TypeScript.

**Summary:**
Monos provide a structured approach using functors/traversables, optimized by monos to run builds quickly. The repository tree structure (root, apps, docs, turbo, versel) ensures isolation and accessibility. While error handling is likely present, specifics are not covered. Further exploration into TypeScript and limitations may be needed for a more comprehensive understanding.
