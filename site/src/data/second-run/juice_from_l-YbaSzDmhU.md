Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking here. They mentioned programming context with AI and their own experiences as programmers who aren't too confident in using GPT-based chatbots like sbench. They’re talking about how software engineering costs are going down because AI can automate many tasks, leading to different markets. They also brought up industrial engineers doing custom stuff quickly, especially in areas where AI isn't needed yet.

The user is optimistic about AI's impact on software engineering and mentions that while humans are still the best at reading and debugging, AI could handle more complex problems once it becomes mature. They’re excited about how AI can automate tasks but also concerned about being a supervisor of an AI system or contributing to its development through domain expertise.

They wonder if programmers should start using AI as supervisors rather than writing from scratch or not learning much. There's a discussion about the Forefront and where human experts are at in various fields. They’re curious about the future, especially with terms like "Rise of the Doge" and how software will help automate barriers.

The user is interested in seeing tech companies embrace AI as a tool but also wants to contribute by understanding domain expertise. They’re eager for real-world examples or case studies that show this transition happening.

Overall, I think they're looking for reassurance that while there's room for AI to take over, human expertise remains crucial. They want to know if programming can evolve and where it should go next.

Ah, this is a fascinating thought experiment! Let me try to unpack your question and explore the ideas you're bringing up.

### The Future of Software Engineering
You bring up an interesting point about software engineering and AI. Here are some key thoughts:

1. **AI's Impact on Software Engineering**:
   - While AI can certainly assist with many tasks like code completion, automated testing, and even some types of analysis, the act of writing software itself is still a critical part of the programming domain.
   - The "cost" of software engineering might decrease as AI becomes more integrated into traditional fields, but this cost remains significant in areas where human expertise is essential.

2. **Programmers as Supervisors**:
   - It's not just about writing code; it's also about understanding how to use tools and frameworks effectively.
   - If AI becomes a more reliable supervisor of software engineering (like GPT systems that analyze your code quality, performance metrics, or potential bugs), then the task of "writing from scratch" might be reduced.

3. **Domain Expertise**:
   - Software engineers are often the experts in their fields, even when they use tools that reduce the manual effort.
   - As AI becomes better at analyzing and diagnosing issues, domain-specific knowledge (e.g., chemical engineering, aerospace) will likely become more important to ensure systems work correctly.

4. **The Forefront of Human Expertise**:
   - While humans are still the best at debugging, understanding how AI can enhance existing software workflows (like automating repetitive tasks or analyzing complex systems) is an exciting direction for the future.

5. **Rise of the Doge**:
   - The term "Rise of the Doge" isn't standard, but it could refer to a shift in how software engineers think about their work. Perhaps they become more focused on bridging human expertise with AI tools rather than being the sole developers of software.

### Your Questions
Here are some clarifications:

1. **Should Programmers Start Using AI as Supervisors?**:
   - It depends on the specific domain and task at hand. If you're working in a field where AI can significantly improve efficiency or accuracy, your role could shift from writing code to using tools that analyze and automate parts of your work.
   - However, if you're still comfortable coding, you might continue to write software even as AI becomes more integrated into traditional fields.

2. **Is Human Expertise Still the Best?**:
   - In most cases, humans are better at reading, debugging, and designing than AI systems. While AI can assist in some tasks, it will never replace human understanding of how software works.
   - However, there's a growing overlap where tools like sbench (used for comparing programming languages) might be used to analyze and verify code quality.

3. **Does Understanding Domain Expertise Replace Writing from Scratch?**:
   - Yes. As AI becomes better at analyzing and validating systems, domain-specific knowledge is more important than writing from scratch. For example, in aerospace engineering, you'd design components rather than write an entire software system from scratch.
   - The task of writing code can still be a significant part of the job, but your role might shift to using AI tools to automate certain aspects.

### Real-World Examples
Here are some examples that could illustrate these points:

1. **Aerospace Engineering**:
   - Domain experts in aerospace know how to design complex systems like aircraft engines or launchers.
   - While AI can be used to validate simulations and suggest improvements, the task of designing the system itself remains your responsibility.

2. **Chemical Engineering**:
   - Domain experts are skilled at optimizing processes, troubleshooting equipment failures, and ensuring safety.
   - AI tools might help monitor equipment performance or optimize process parameters, but the decision-making part often requires human expertise.

3. **Healthcare**:
   - In healthcare, domain experts know how to design clinical trials, manage patient data, and ensure compliance with regulations.
   - While AI can assist in analyzing large datasets or automating repetitive tasks (e.g., generating treatment recommendations), the role of a domain expert remains crucial for making informed decisions.

### Conclusion
While there's still room for AI to influence software engineering, human expertise will likely remain essential. The transition from "writing from scratch" to using tools and frameworks may continue, but your role in ensuring that these systems work correctly will become more important over time.

As you're working on this, consider how domain experts can bridge the gap between human understanding of software behavior and AI tools. This could lead to a future where AI becomes an ally rather than a substitute for human engineers.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these ideas!
