Alright, let me try to figure out what the user is going through. So they're talking about setting up their first Proximous Backup Server, which sounds like a big step for them. I see they've got some pretty detailed steps in their message. They mention subscribing to the playlist linked below and offering to help with drive costs, which shows that they value their setup beyond just the technical stuff.

The user starts by asking how to set up Proximous Backup Server today, so my first thought is to break down each step clearly. They might be a bit overwhelmed or unsure about where to start, hence the detailed steps they provided. I should keep it structured but not too overwhelming, probably starting with installing the server and then moving on from there.

They also mention their drive costs, which suggests they're considering buying drives with warranties or maybe using something like Amazon EC2. They included a link for Proximous Drive Costs, so that's helpful. I need to make sure to mention those links because it gives them options without going through the full setup.

In terms of recommendations, they suggest looking at other guides and affiliate links. That adds value beyond just following this video, maybe giving them more resources or encouragement to continue learning. 

I wonder if they're also thinking about backups for different systemsâ€”like from their laptop or another server. It would be good to mention that since backup can sometimes go wrong with anything. Also, the mention of cool stuff like remote file backups implies they might want to set up multiple servers or have cloud backup in mind.

They end by asking if they've had a great day and leave an emoji, which is playful but makes the message feel friendly. 

I think I should make sure each step is clear and concise without being too technical, so that someone new can follow along easily. Maybe using bullet points would help, especially for the installation steps since it's a big process.

Also, including links to drive costs and Proximous Drive Costs makes sense because those are practical tips they might not have thought of yet. It shows they're not just reading but actually planning their setup.

I should make sure each section flows logically from one step to the next, building on what was covered before without repeating too much. That way, viewers can follow along without getting lost in information.

Overall, the user seems proactive about setting up Proximous Backup Server and is looking for guidance that's both thorough and practical. By providing clear steps, drive cost tips, and recommendations for further resources, I think they'll feel confident starting their setup journey.
