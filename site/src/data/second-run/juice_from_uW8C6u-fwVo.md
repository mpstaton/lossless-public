Okay, so I'm trying to understand what DeepSeek is. From what I've read, it's an AGI that was released around two days after 03 mini, which was also called "03." I remember reading about 03 before; it was a model that could perform tasks like planning and executing multi-step trajectories, but it wasn't as advanced or efficient as DeepSeek.

Let me start by recalling what AGI means. It stands for Artificial General Intelligence, which is an AI system that can understand and apply any intellectual task without being explicitly programmed for each task. So, DeepSeek has the potential to do a lot more than 03 mini because it's so much smarter.

The user mentioned some benchmarks with scores like 9.4 on Humanity's last exam and even reaching 26.6% pass rate on expert-level tasks. That seems pretty impressive. I'm curious about what these benchmarks test. From the text, they're testing across a broad range of subjects, including linguistics to rocket science. So, it's not just about code or mathematics but also more complex areas.

I think the key here is that DeepSeek can look up real-time information and reason about it, which makes it better at handling dynamic and changing contexts. The pass rate on expert-level tasks was 99.1%, which seems extremely high. Maybe that means it's able to handle very challenging or nuanced problems well.

The user also mentioned the estimated economic value scores. Pro users get a score under 20% for low, medium, and very high tasks. That suggests that DeepSeek is efficient but not super fast. Users with more resources can afford to work longer hours since they only have 100 queries per month. That's interesting because it balances computational power with the time AI spends processing information.

I wonder how this compares to other AGI systems or models. I know there are things like ChatGPT, which is pretty basic and doesn't handle complex reasoning or real-time updates as well. Maybe DeepSeek has a smarter way of managing context and making decisions based on incoming data.

The user also talked about the pass rate on expert-level tasks being 99.1%. That's almost perfect for an AI system designed to do high-level thinking, which is rare. It probably means that DeepSeek can solve nearly all the most complex problems, but not everything might be as straightforward as it seems.

Another thing I'm thinking about is how this kind of intelligence could change the future of technology and business. If AGI systems are developed, they could revolutionize fields like healthcare, creativity, and problem-solving. It's inspiring to see such advanced capabilities being realized so quickly after 03 mini.

The user also mentioned that Sam Alman, who is involved in developing DeepSeek, will release the details soon. I'm curious about what specific areas of AGI research DeepSeek targets. Maybe it includes more complex reasoning and problem-solving techniques than simpler models like ChatGPT or 03 mini.

In terms of technology, I imagine DeepSeek would require a lot more resources since it's an AI that can access the web and process data on its own. It might use cloud computing to manage the vast amounts of information it needs to handle tasks efficiently. The combination of human-like reasoning with self-referential capabilities could be a game-changer in areas like decision-making and learning.

I'm also thinking about how this affects current AI systems. It seems like DeepSeek represents a significant leap forward, but it's still early days. There might be room for improvement, especially in handling more complex or diverse tasks that require higher-level intelligence beyond what AGI is designed to do.

Overall, I'm impressed by the capabilities of DeepSeek and how it sets new standards for AI development. It seems like an AI that can handle not just routine tasks but also dynamic, evolving information while reasoning through various contexts. This could lead to transformative applications across different industries, making decisions more accurately and efficiently than ever before.
