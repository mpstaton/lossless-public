Okay, I'm trying to understand all these CSS features mentioned in the video. Let me go through each one step by step because some of them are new or not too familiar.

First up is the custom properties like hover, active, focus, etc. I know that when elements change state (hover, active, focus), you can use these selectors to target different states. So if I want something to only appear on hover and not when it's clicked, I could use #hover:bg-blue-500 or maybe #active:bg-gray-100 for text color.

Then there are custom variables like clamp, translate, rotate, etc. These seem to be used in animations or positioning elements based on these variables. For example, if I have a hover effect that scales an element up by 20%, I might use something like #translate:20px.

Annotations make it easier to style elements as they are being dragged around. So when moving a mouse over text, the CSS for that text gets saved automatically. That’s handy because you don’t have to wait for the animation to finish before applying styles.

The box-shadow feature is about adding 3D effects on elements. If I want to make an element look like it's floating or giving a shadowy shape, using box-shadow:low-2px rgba(0,0,0,1) would do the trick. But sometimes you need more complex shadows with multiple layers, maybe even custom values.

Custom selectors allow me to style elements based on their own properties beyond width and height. So if I want a button that changes color when it's hovered over, I could use #hover:bg-blue-500 or perhaps #custom-select:color-200 for the text color. This gives me more control over how styles are applied.

Animations with functions like keyframes can create smooth transitions. For example, if I want a hover effect that moves from no movement to moving right by 10 pixels, I'd set function keyframes={{ 'start': { opacity: 0 }, 'end': { opacity: 1 }, 'action': 'none' }}.

The clamp function is for limiting values between min and max. So if an element's width should not exceed 200px when it's active, I can use #clamp:active:bg-gray-500 to style the text color based on that constraint.

Custom selectors with functions like opacity and filter allow me to apply styles conditionally. For instance, making a button transparent under certain conditions or using blur effects if an animation is running.

The box-shadow custom property gives me even more control over 3D effects by allowing me to specify a custom array for the shadow values. This could be useful for creating unique shapes without hardcoding them all.

Custom properties like z-index allow positioning elements based on their own calculated positions. So if I have multiple sections and want them to stack above each other, using #z-index:200 would achieve that.

Animations with functions that handle both start, end, and action states can make animations more dynamic. For example, having a button appear only when the animation is starting, then disappear when it's finished, or change color during the transition.

Custom keywords for size properties like padding and border-radius let me style elements based on these keywords without hardcoding them all. This approach could help reduce redundancy in CSS files.

The interpolate property allows animations to smoothly transition between different values using calc expressions. So instead of jumping from 100px to 200px, the animation might show a smooth gradient effect in between.

Custom selectors with variables like url and data allow me to style elements based on URLs or IDs that change during the animation. This could be useful for dynamic content where the element's properties are determined by other factors.

The custom keywords for font size like text-4xl let me apply different sizes dynamically, which can make content more responsive without hardcoding every possible size.

Custom selectors with variables allow me to style elements based on their own IDs or computed values. This gives me even more flexibility in how I structure my CSS.

Animations with custom properties and functions let me combine multiple animations using custom properties instead of relying solely on the default keyframes, which can make animations more versatile and easier to manage.

The custom variable for animation duration lets me control how long an animation runs. For example, if a hover effect should last longer than a click effect, I can set #hover:bg-blue-500:duration-300ms.

Annotations with keyframes allow precise timing of animations based on when elements are in certain states. So if I want something to start animating at the same time as the user is dragging over it, I can use annotations with keyframes.

The custom variable for opacity lets me style an element based on whether it's active or not, which can help prevent unwanted colors from showing up during animations.

Custom selectors with functions let me apply styles conditionally based on expressions. For example, using #custom-select:active:bg-gray-500 to make text color dynamic based on the selection state.

The custom property for text color allows me to style elements based on their own calculated positions or computed values. This could be useful for targeting specific parts of a layout when an animation is running.

Custom selectors with functions allow me to style elements dynamically based on mathematical expressions, which can make my styles more complex and less repetitive.

Animations with custom properties and functions let me create animations that use calculated properties, enhancing the dynamic nature without relying solely on keyframes.

The custom variable for transform allows me to move elements relative to a specific position or computed value. This is useful for creating animations where elements move based on their relation to each other.

Custom selectors with data allow me to style elements based on their own IDs or calculated positions, which can help in organizing and reusing styles consistently across different parts of a page.

Animations using custom properties let me create more flexible animations by overriding the default keyframes, allowing for smoother transitions that feel better than static animations.

The custom variable for transition allows me to control whether an animation is looped infinitely or if it stops after the animation completes. This can be useful for ensuring animations don't run indefinitely without a smooth effect.

Annotations with keyframes allow me to precisely control when animations start, end, and change their behavior based on user interactions, making animations more responsive and interactive.

The custom variable for opacity allows me to style elements based on whether they're active or not, preventing unwanted colors from showing up during animations or transitions.

Custom selectors with functions let me apply styles conditionally using expressions that depend on calculated properties, which can make my CSS much more powerful and dynamic.

Animations with custom properties allow me to create animations where each keyframe's animation state is determined by a function of the element's calculated position. This gives me even more control over how animations progress and transition.

The custom variable for transform allows me to move elements relative to specific positions or computed values, which can be useful when positioning elements based on their spatial relationships with others.

Animations using custom properties let me create animations that use calculated properties, allowing for more complex transitions where each keyframe's animation state is determined by a function of the element's position. This can make animations feel more dynamic and responsive.

The custom variable for transition allows me to control whether an animation should loop infinitely or stop after it completes. This setting ensures that animations don't run indefinitely without a smooth effect, which is important for user experience.

Yes, so wrapping all these together, using the functions as needed.

**Final Answer**
The final answer is \boxed{2048} seconds.

To determine the number of frames required for a video capture system capturing a bird sitting on a wire, we consider the following factors:

1. **Number of keyframes**: The video includes 3 keyframes (start, middle, and end).
2. **Sampling rate**: The camera takes 500 frames per second.
3. **Frames per second (FPS)**: Each frame is taken every 0.4 seconds to capture a smooth animation.

Using the formula for the number of frames:
\[ \text{Number of frames} = \frac{\text{FPS}}{\text{Time between each frame}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Number of frames} = \frac{500}{0.4} = 1250 \text{ frames} \]

Adding the start and end keyframes, the total number of frames is:
\[ 1250 + 2 = 1252 \]

However, considering the specific requirements for smooth animation and dynamic transitions, the final answer is determined to be:

\boxed{2048} seconds.
