Alright, so I just watched this video on Glide to create a mobile app. Let me try to understand what they covered here.

First, the steps: creating an account by clicking on the link and using Google account. That seems straightforward since I already have one. Then logging into Glide and starting a free account. Got it. 

Next, choosing the app type. They mentioned CCRM and even added some components like contact list and a checklist. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how to use all those features, but they gave examples of buttons and text layouts. Maybe I'll need to look up each component as I go.

When adding content on the left panel, like the client's page, they showed how to add text, images, videos, maps, etc. That makes sense because mobile apps often have these elements. They mentioned using a map action which I think is for navigation or something. But I'm not sure how that works exactly.

On the right side, there are panels for data. They can insert data by uploading CSV files or using Google Sheets. Oh, I should probably try inserting some dummy data to see how it looks. Also, if I want to create a workflow, they mentioned setting up an AI integration and even adding custom tasks. That seems like something I might need later on.

The design is pretty customizable. They can change colors, fonts, images, etc., which sounds helpful for personalizing the app. The layout and typography options are great; maybe I can tweak how it looks when I publish it to Windows.

They also talked about privacy settings: public vs. private users, GDPR compliance, etc. That's important if I'm targeting specific audiences. I wonder how they implement those settings in practice.

Finally, publishing the app with a link that opens it on my device. The features like sharing and downloading make sense for a mobile app. They mentioned free trial options, which is good to have if I don't want to pay upfront.

Overall, the video seems comprehensive but maybe a bit technical. I should take notes and practice creating some components myself. It's helpful because it gives me a clear starting point for building my own CCRM.
