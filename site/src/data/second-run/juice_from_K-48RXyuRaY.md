Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a text about introducing a new AI transcription model. They want me to extract specific sections from it: SUMMARY, IDEAS, INSIGHTS, etc.

First, the input is quite dense in Chinese, so I'll need to translate that into English since the output should be Markdown. The summary needs 25 words including who and content. So maybe something like "Introducing the most advanced AI transcription model..." that's under 25.

Next, IDEAS: extract 20-50 ideas from the text. It mentions features like character level timestamps, Hippa compliance, multispeaker diarization, etc. I'll list each point clearly, making sure not to repeat anything and keeping it concise.

For INSIGHTS, I need to refine these ideas, maybe using more specific terms or removing redundant points. For example, instead of just mentioning accuracy, I can say "highest accuracy across all languages."

RECOMMENDATIONS should be 15-30 recommendations. This text talks about building an app for transcription, so a clear recommendation like expanding the model's capabilities sounds good.

FACTS: extract surprising info. Maybe things like highest accuracy or multi-speaker diarization being key points here.

HABITS: talk about features like character-level timestamps and diarization, so I'll list these out with their exact details.

REFERENCES: mention the main language used, which is English in this case.

Finally, I need to make sure all output sections meet the word count requirements for IDEAS (at least 20), INSIGHTS (10-20), etc., and each bullet point is exactly 16 words. Also, avoid repeating any ideas, quotes, facts, or sources.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to structure it step by step.
