Okay, the user provided a detailed query about C-Storm, an AI research tool. They started by sharing their own video explaining it, so they're looking to expand on that. Let me go through each part of their query.

First, they mentioned "a long time back" when I explained the original Storm tool and how C-Storm is an evolution. So, in my response, I should highlight the differences clearly. They also want a step-by-step guide, which means including installation steps on local machines would be helpful. Maybe break it down into cloning a repository with Git, installing dependencies, and running it.

They mentioned using Git for local setup, so I'll include that as a method to get started without needing an API. It's important to note the community support since they might want additional resources or tips there.

The video part is a bit unclear though. They wrote about installing locally but didn't specify how exactly. I should probably mention using Git and suggesting specific commands, like `git clone --recursive -b myusername`, so users know how to start their own projects.

They also mentioned other AI tools, which makes me think of offering more resources in the future. Maybe adding a section on installing local setups or exploring community-based approaches could be useful.

I should wrap it up by encouraging engagement and support, as that's crucial for building an audience. Mentioning Discord might attract tech enthusiasts who are into community-driven content.

Overall, my goal is to make the information clear, easy to follow, and appealing, so the user can effectively use C-Storm for their projects.

It seems like you're referring to a video I created that explains how to install a local setup of C-Storm. If you'd like to learn more about using C-Storm locally or want to explore other AI-related tools, here are some additional tips:

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide (Local Setup)
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use Git to clone the repository on your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive -b "yourusername" https://github.com/YourAICommunity/C-Storm
   ```
   Replace `"yourusername"` with a name or number that fits your needs.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the necessary Python packages by running these commands in the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you donâ€™t have `requirements.txt`, create it with:
   ```bash
   make requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Tool locally**  
   You can run C-Storm locally by executing these commands in a Python shell:
   ```python
   import sys
   from cstorm.core import core
   sys.path.insert(0, "your local directory")
   core()
   ```
   Replace `"your local directory"` with the path you cloned to.

4. **Run from the Command Line**  
   If you want to start C-Storm from the command line, simply run:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Why Local Setup Matters
- **Customization and Replicability**: Running locally allows you to customize the tool with your own code or algorithms.
- **Community Support**: You can access a wealth of community resources, tutorials, and pre-trained models.
- **Simplicity**: Local setup is simpler than using an API or cloud-based services.

### Other AI Tools for Local Setup
If you're interested in installing local setups for other AI-related tools:
1. **GitHub Actions**  
   Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the tasks from within a single file (like a Python package):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   run .
   ```
2. **GitLab CI**  
   If you're on GitLab, you can use their continuous integration for local setups:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Community Support
If you're interested in more community-driven AI tools or tutorials, consider reaching out to the AI community on platforms like GitHub, Reddit, or Slack. The **GitHub Discussions** and **Discord** communities are great places to ask questions or share tips.
