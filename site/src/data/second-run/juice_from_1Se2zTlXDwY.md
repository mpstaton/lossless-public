Alright, so I need to help someone who's dealing with a lot of confusion around different degrees and their relevance. They seem to be struggling with understanding that not all PhDs are in the same field, which can lead to frustration because they expect someone who's a CS Engineer to cover everything.

First, I should acknowledge their feelings about this confusion. It's important to validate their experience because it shows empathy. Then, I need to explain clearly why this is happening: there are so many degrees out there that don't overlap with software engineering or computer science.

I can break it down into categories like CS, EE, AI, and other fields. For each category, give examples of what's included but not in CS. For instance, electrical engineers or mechanical engineers might have different skills and knowledge than software developers.

It's also important to address why this is confusing for themâ€”maybe they've seen a list where CS is at the top, so they're expecting everything else. But real life shows that it varies widely based on what's in their degree.

I should encourage them to think about how they want their education and maybe suggest exploring different degrees or certifications if they're unsure. This way, they can find something relevant to their career goals without feeling overwhelmed by the confusion.

It sounds like you're dealing with a common confusion that many people face regarding degrees of study and their relevance to careers. Here's a breakdown to help clarify:

### Degrees vs. Skills
Degrees of study can vary widely, but some may not overlap with software engineering or computer science degrees. For example:
- **Electrical Engineering**: Focuses on electrical circuits, systems, and components.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Deals with mechanics and design.
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Combines aerospace principles with technical expertise.
- **Civil Engineering**: Focuses on structures, land use, and urban planning.

### Why There's a Confusion
It can be confusing because many people see their degree as the ultimate measure of their qualifications. For example:
- If you're in a CS degree, others might expect you to have skills equivalent to a software engineer.
- However, real-world applications often require different skill sets and knowledge areas.

### Why This Can Be Compelling
The idea that software engineering degrees are "the worst" is understandable because it can make job searching feel like everything is covered by the CS degree. However, in reality, many jobs require skills beyond just programming or software development. For example:
- Data science requires a strong understanding of statistics and machine learning.
- Software testing often involves understanding systems and user interactions.

### How to Address This
1. **Clarify Your Goals**: Are you looking for a CS degree for a technical role, an EE degree for an engineering position, or an AI degree for a cutting-edge field?
2. **Explore Different Paths**: If your degree isn't aligning with your career goals, consider exploring other fields of study or certifications.
3. **Consider Certifications**: Sometimes, certifications or advanced degrees can provide more specialized skills.

### Final Thoughts
The confusion arises from the diverse nature of degrees and their overlap with technical skills. The key takeaway is that while software engineering degrees are valuable, they aren't the only path to success in many fields. Focus on what aligns with your interests and career aspirations!
