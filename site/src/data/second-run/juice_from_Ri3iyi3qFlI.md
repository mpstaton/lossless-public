Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user provided some code snippets about an AI agent created using Archon as an mCP server. They even ran through an example of how it works on a specific question. Now, they want to expand on this with more content and perhaps create a video or a detailed explanation.

First, I need to understand what's going on in the provided code. It looks like they're using the brave AI framework, which allows agents to interact with the web search tool through commands. The agent is created within an mCP server environment, which probably handles the interactions between the agent and the web.

Looking at the code, there's a chat interface where users can ask questions. The agent responds by executing web commands using Archon. For example, when someone asks about Elon Musk's net worth, the agent runs a web command to get that information from the brave API.

The user also mentions creating an example video for this project. I should think about how to structure that. Maybe break it down into sections: introduction, how it works, step-by-step explanation, and some more advanced features or examples.

I need to make sure the code is properly formatted so that viewers can run it in a Jupyter notebook. Also, including some visualizations like chat history would help illustrate the process clearly.

What could be expanded? Maybe adding more details on how specific web commands work within Archon, or showing real-time interactions with other agents if they're part of a larger project. Also, perhaps discussing potential use cases beyond the example provided to show its versatility.

I should also consider any challenges faced during development, like initial confusion about how Archon handles web requests versus regular AI responses. Addressing these will make the explanation more robust and helpful.

Overall, the goal is to take the code they provided and turn it into a comprehensive video tutorial or blog post that explains the concept thoroughly while showing practical examples of its use.

Alright, let's dive deeper into how Archon can be used to create an AI agent for interacting with web search. I'll break this down step by step.

---

### 1. **Understanding Archon**
Archon is a web interface designed specifically for creating agents that can interact with the web through commands. It allows you to build agents that respond to questions and queries made via web requests, without needing to program every possible feature manually.

For example:
- Your agent could ask: "What is the net worth of Elon Musk?"
- You'd run a command like ` ElonMusk` into Archon.
- Archon would return the answer from the web search interface.

---

### 2. **Setting Up Your Environment**
To use Archon for creating an AI agent, you'll need to:

#### Step 1: Install the necessary packages
```bash
pip install websearch
```

#### Step 2: Create an mCP server instance
This is where your Archon will run and process queries.

```python
# Create an mCP server instance with Archon
server = archon.mcp_server("your_api_key_here")
```

---

### 3. **Setting Up Your Chat Interface**
To make it easier for users to interact with the agent, you'll need a chat interface similar to ChatGPT.

#### Step 1: Create a chat history
```python
# Initialize the chat history
chat_history = []
current_query = None
```

#### Step 2: Handle user queries
When a user types in a query:
```python
while True:
    if current_query == "exit":
        print("Thanks for asking! How about Elon Musk's net worth?")
        break
    else:
        # Process the query
        response = server.query(current_query)
        chat_history.append({"text": current_query, "response": response})
        print("\nQuery:", current_query)
        print(response.strip())
        current_query = input("\nEnter your question or 'exit' to finish: ")
```

---

### 4. **Example with a Real AI Agent**
Let's create an example of an AI agent that asks about the net worth of Elon Musk.

```python
def get_net_worth():
    while True:
        query = input("Enter your question about Elon Musk or 'exit' to finish: ")
        if query == "exit":
            print("\nNet Worth of Elon Musk:\n$400 billion")
            return
        response = server.query(query)
        chat_history.append({"text": query, "response": response.strip()})
        print(f"{query}: {response.strip()}")

get_net_worth()
```

---

### 5. **Advanced Features**
Archon can be used for much more complex scenarios:

#### a. **Self-Referential Agents**
You could create an agent that self-corrects its responses based on the web search interface.

```python
def build_self_correcting_agent():
    while True:
        query = input("Enter your question about Elon Musk or 'exit' to finish: ")
        if query == "exit":
            print("\nSelf-Corrected Response for Elon Musk's net worth:\n$400 billion")
            return
        response = server.query(query)
        chat_history.append({"text": query, "response": response.strip()})
        print(f"{query}: {response.strip()}")

build_self_correcting_agent()
```

#### b. **Multi-Agent Interaction**
You could create an agent that interacts with another AI agent.

```python
def multi_agent_interaction():
    while True:
        agent1_query = input("Enter query for AI agent 1: ")
        if agent1_query == "exit":
            break
        response1 = server.query(agent1_query)
        chat_history.append({"text": "AI Agent 1", "query": agent1_query, "response": response1.strip()})
        
        agent2_query = input("Enter query for AI agent 2: ")
        if agent2_query == "exit":
            break
        response2 = server.query(agent2_query)
        chat_history.append({"text": "AI Agent 2", "query": agent2_query, "response": response2.strip()})
        
    print("\nBoth agents have responded to their queries.")

multi_agent_interaction()
```

---

### 6. **Visualizing the Chat History**
To better understand how your AI is processing and responding to each query, you can visualize the chat history.

```python
# Import required libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get latest conversation
latest = chat_history[-1]
query = latest["text"]
response = latest["response"]

# Create a line plot of chat history
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
x = [i for i in range(len(chat_history))]
y = [h["text"].strip() for h in chat_history]

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', markersize=5)
plt.title(f"Chat History with query: {query}")
plt.xlabel("Message Index")
plt.ylabel("Message Text")
plt.show()
```

---

### 7. **Conclusion**
Archon is a powerful framework that allows you to create AI agents for web search without needing deep domain knowledge. By setting up your chat interface and defining your queries, you can build sophisticated AI agents tailored to your needs.

To get started:
1. Set up Archon and mCP server.
2. Create a chat history.
3. Define your query and process the response.
4. Visualize the chat history for better understanding.
