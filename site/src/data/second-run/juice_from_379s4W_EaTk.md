Okay, so the user is sharing their thoughts on three AI books and wants more. Let me break down each book they've read.

First up is "In today's AI world: Why LLMs are changing everything." This seems to focus on large language models and how they're transforming industries. It probably covers the future trends and real-world applications, which would be useful for someone looking into AI's impact beyond just LMs.

Next, "The art of machine learning in the 21st century: A practical guide." This book likely dives deeper into ML techniques, including transformers, data engineering, and deployment. It might have a lot of hands-on examples and case studies, which would be helpful for someone looking to apply these concepts practically.

Lastly, "LM Engineers handbook: Master the art of building large language models from concept to production." This seems more technical with a focus on the architecture and tools involved in developing LLMs. It probably includes detailed steps on setting up systems, monitoring, and deployment, which could be great for someone interested in backend AI solutions.

The user mentioned they already read these books, so maybe they're looking for additional resources or different perspectives. They might want to explore even more technical details, case studies, or perhaps some specific use cases beyond the basics covered in the books. It's also possible they're looking for ways to integrate these concepts into their current projects or educational settings.

I should make sure I cover a variety of angles—whether it's theoretical insights from each book, practical applications, deeper dives into specific areas like prompt engineering, and maybe some supplementary materials that can complement these readings. Also, considering the user’s technical background, they might appreciate more detailed explanations on certain topics or additional exercises to reinforce their understanding.
