Okay, so I just saw this tutorial about pantic AI. It's all about building an agent using different models. Let me try to understand what each part is doing.

First, they're importing some modules: agent from penic Ai, openai and Llama from identi models. Hmm, I've heard of Penic AIs before; maybe it's a different version? Or perhaps it's another framework that uses the same concepts. OpenAI seems familiar too, I think they're related to AI and using open-source platforms for their models.

They start by creating an instance of the model with specific API keys or base URLs. Like, for Llama 321b, maybe that's the base URL with the key? So when you run agent run sync, it uses this model to generate responses. That makes sense because it's using a real model.

Then they print out the result and list the models. I wonder how they do thatâ€”using some module or function. Maybe they call space list to see all installed models locally. And there are these colored messages like red for the answer, which probably uses colorama for styling the output. That would make the tutorials look more professional.

In the next example, they switch to an AMA model. They have to ensure their server is running and downloaded the model before using it. Then they just run agent run with a prompt asking for the capital of Mexico. The answer comes back quickly because they're using another real model from open AI.

So I'm thinking pantic AI allows you to use different models, each with their own set of parameters. It seems like this tutorial is setting up the basic setup and getting started with two models: Llama 321b and Ammari llama. Maybe in the next parts they'll cover more complex scenarios or how to integrate multiple agents.

I'm also curious about why they used colorama. That's a Python library for styling text, right? So it helps make the output look better and more professional. It's probably part of their tutorials or documentation style.

Overall, this seems like a good introduction to pantic AI. They covered importing necessary modules, creating model instances with keys or URLs, running the agents, and getting responses. They also showed how to debug using lock fire, which is good practice for developers. The use of colorama makes it look clean and professional.

I think if I continued learning from this, I'd get into more complex topics like configuration management, monitoring, and possibly integrating multiple agents or cloud providers. But for now, understanding the basics with these examples seems solid.

This tutorial introduces pantic AI, a framework designed to build production-ready systems by leveraging key features such as type checking, dependency injection, and real models. Here's an organized summary of the tutorial:

### Key Features Covered:
1. **Module Imports**: The tutorial imports necessary modules from pantic AI, OpenAI, and Llama, which are essential for building agents using different models.
2. **Model Instances Creation**:
   - Uses `openai.GPT` with a specific API key or base URL to create an instance of the model used by Llama 321b.
   - Ensures the server runs on the local host and the model is downloaded before execution.
3. **Agent Execution**:
   - Runs agents using `agent.run` with prompts asking for predefined responses (e.g., "What's the capital of Mexico?").
   - Demonstrates how different models can be used to generate accurate, real-world responses.
4. **Debugging and Output Management**: Utilizes `lock fire` for debugging and `colorama` for styling outputs, enhancing professional presentation.

### Highlights:
- The tutorial starts with a simple "Hello World" example using Llama 321b, showcasing how models can be set up and used within pantic AI.
- Introduces the use of Ammari's llama model as an alternative to Llama for testing and different scenarios.
- Emphasizes best practices, including server setup, model preparation, and debugging strategies.

### Conclusion:
This tutorial provides a solid foundation in setting up and using pantic AI models. It demonstrates how to leverage different models within the framework, manage outputs effectively, and integrate agents for various responses. The introduction sets the stage for more advanced topics like configuration management, monitoring, and integration with cloud providers.
