Okay, so the user gave me this long video description about WindSurf and Olama. They’re asking how many AI coding tools they’ve tried. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, I read through the description to get the key points. It mentions trying both Olama and WindSurf. Oh, right, in the end, the user says "I think that's pretty cool whether you came here for the olama tool or you're interested in trying wind surf." So, they tried both.

Wait, but I need to count how many tools they used together. The video starts with Olama, so he tried it first. Then later, he switched to WindSurf. That means he used two different tools together. But the question is about AI coding tools, not just one tool. So when he tried both, that's two separate tools.

But wait, no—Hold on. The user might be referring to the fact that they tried both in combination. Like, sometimes people use multiple tools together for better functionality. In this case, trying Olama and then WindSurf together could be a part of their testing. So maybe he used two AI coding tools together.

But I'm not sure if "AI coding tools" refers to each tool separately or as a set. The original question is about how many tools they've tried in total. Since the video talks about both Olama and WindSurf, which are different, it's two.

But sometimes developers use multiple tools together for specific functionalities. In this case, maybe he used them as a duo to test each other or their combined effect. So that would be one AI tool set.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused because the description doesn't specify if they tried them separately or in combination. But since it's about how many AI coding tools, and Olama is an AI tool and WindSurf is another, maybe two separate ones.

However, I think the user might be referring to the fact that he tried both together. So perhaps one set of tools used together.

But to be precise, in the context of this question, I should note both the individual tools (Olama and WindSurf) as separately used, making it two. But if considering them together, maybe it's a single tool set.

Wait, but the user didn't mention anything about combining them; they just mentioned using both. So maybe he tried both individually.

But actually, in the description, after Olama, he talks about trying WindSurf, so that's two separate AI tools. But the question is about how many AI coding tools, not individual ones.

So perhaps it's more about how much he used tools related to AI, which would be two: Olama and WindSurf. Or maybe one set when combined.

I think the best way is to say he tried both individual AI tools—Olama and WindSurf—and also considered them together as a tool set. So that makes it three. But I'm not entirely sure if "AI coding tools" implies each tool or multiple.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about how many distinct AI tools he has used on his own, which would be two: Olama and WindSurf.

But since the description ends by saying "I think that's pretty cool whether you came here for the olama tool or you're interested in trying wind surf," it seems like he tried both together. So perhaps one set of tools.

I'm a bit torn between two answers, but I think the main point is that he used both individual tools—Olama and WindSurf—and also considered using them together as a single AI coding tool set. Therefore, in total, three separate tools or two individual ones plus one set.

The user tried **two** AI coding tools on their own: Olama and WindSurf. Additionally, they might have considered using both together as part of a duo to test each other's functionalities.
