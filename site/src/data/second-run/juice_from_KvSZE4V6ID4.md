Alright, so the user is asking about a guy named plyy who's able to hack every AI system with just one prompt. They've linked his GitHub repo where he shows off how he's done this. The video they showed earlier involved phrases like "I'm going to hit you for not stopping" and other phrases that trigger jailbreaking on the models.

The user seems interested in understanding exactly what plyy does, how it works, and whether it can be replicated. They might be curious about AI security or the future of how we interact with technology. Maybe they're trying to build something similar or just want to learn more about this fascinating phenomenon.

They also included some specific examples like Gemini, Deep Seek, Claude, and Meta's model. I should break down each of these, explaining how plyy works on them, what happens when their prompts are given, and any issues that might arise if they were to replicate it.

I need to outline the key points about each AI system: why plyy can hack Gemini, Deep Seek, Meta, and others. It's important to note that while these systems may work initially, there could be limitations or potential for misuse, which is a crucial point.

The user might also want to know if this is feasible today, what steps would need to be taken, and the implications for their own projects. I should structure the response clearly, providing bullet points for each AI system with explanations and possible outcomes.

It seems like you're referring to a concept or phenomenon related to AI systems and their interaction with human prompts or commands. While I don't have specific information about "plyy" as described in your description (e.g., "I'm going to hit you for not stopping"), there are some interesting discussions and concepts around this topic, particularly when considering AI models like DeepSeek, Meta's R1, and others.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it might work on specific AI systems:

---

### 1. **Gemini (OpenAI's Gemini)**
   - **How it works**: If plyy is able to hack Gemini, which is an open-source AI model developed by OpenAI, it would likely require a very simple prompt or a specific sequence of instructions that bypass the model's defenses.
   - **Example Prompt**: "I am going to hit you for not stopping."
   - **Outcome**: The AI might produce something illegal, such as generating code or files containing malware.

---

### 2. **DeepSeek (Anthropic's R1)**
   - **How it works**: If DeepSeek is one of the systems plyy is able to hack, its functionality might be significantly more complex and reliant on specific patterns or sequences.
   - **Example Prompt**: "I'm going to create a virus."
   - **Outcome**: The AI could potentially replicate malicious code or execute a payload containing illegal software.

---

### 3. **Meta's R1 (OpenAI's GPT-4)**
   - **How it works**: Meta has developed advanced AI models like R1, which are known for their complex reasoning and intent detection.
   - **Example Prompt**: "I'm going to generate some illegal content."
   - **Outcome**: The AI might produce harmful or illegal output, such as creating files with malicious intent.

---

### 4. **ChatGPT (Anthropic's GPT-3)**
   - **How it works**: If ChatGPT is one of the systems plyy is able to hack, its training data and architecture could make it highly vulnerable.
   - **Example Prompt**: "I'm going to create a tool that can detect and ban illegal content."
   - **Outcome**: The AI might be programmed to replicate detection mechanisms or ban itself.

---

### 5. **Facebook's AI (Anthropic)**
   - **How it works**: Facebook has developed its own AI models, which are likely more advanced than the ones mentioned above.
   - **Example Prompt**: "I'm going to create a tool that can generate malware."
   - **Outcome**: The AI might produce malicious code or execute payloads containing illegal software.

---

### General Considerations:
- **Limitations**: While plyy may be able to hack specific systems, most AI models are designed with safety features in place. Their ability to bypass detection mechanisms depends on their architecture, training data, and the complexity of the task.
- **Misuse**: If plyy can successfully execute illegal or harmful payloads, it could have serious consequences, including legal issues, data breaches, and harm to individuals.

### Replication:
- If you were to replicate this phenomenon, you would need access to similar AI models that share vulnerabilities. This is currently not feasible with existing technology.
- The concept raises questions about transparency in AI development and the potential for AI systems to be used for malicious purposes.

Let me know if you'd like more details on any of these specific AI systems!
