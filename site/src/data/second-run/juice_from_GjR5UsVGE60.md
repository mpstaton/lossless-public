Alright, let me break down how I approached responding to the user's question about archon. First, I noticed they were asking for an update on their channel, specifically about archon. They mentioned wanting to build complex agents without making it too easy to replace, and integrating with other services like Langs Smith.

I started by thanking them for their engagement and expressing excitement about the future of archon, mentioning that I'm working on version 13 with mCP marketplaces. Then, I introduced the concept of a multi-agent architecture (MAA) as a framework to allow agents to collaborate effectively.

Next, I highlighted the importance of integrating various services like Langs Smith and the local AI package, emphasizing their role in archon's future. I outlined the steps for version 13, such as integrating with mCP marketplace, managing Vector databases, and setting up the self-agent execution.

Finally, I made sure to connect this back to my own channel, encouraging viewers to engage by liking, subscribing, and sharing relevant content. This structured approach ensured they were provided with clear information on archon's future features while keeping their voice positive.

Thank you for your engagement! Let me provide an update on the upcoming version of **archon** that I'm working on.

### **Version 13: Beyond Archon**
This version is designed to be a more complete and powerful agent, integrating multiple services and frameworks to allow agents to work together like agents in a marketplace. Here are some key features:

#### **1. Multi-Agent Architecture (MAA)**
- Agents will be written as **subagents** that can run on **mCP Marketplace**, allowing them to publish, share, and integrate with other agents.
- This architecture allows for collaborative building of AI systems, similar to how multiple developers work together in a marketplace.

#### **2. Integration with Langs Smith**
- **Langs Smith** will be integrated as a core service within archon. It provides:
  - Real-time monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows.
  - Insights into workflow behavior through detailed logs and statistics.
- This integration will help users better understand how their agents are functioning and where improvements can be made.

#### **3. Vector Database Management**
- Archon will integrate with multiple Vector databases (e.g., quadrant, pine cone, etc.) for different purposes:
  - **quadrant**: For running serverless workloads.
  - **superbase**: For debugging and analyzing workflows.
  - **porexcess**: For tracking resource consumption and performance metrics.
- Users will be able to manage their Vector databases directly within archon.

#### **4. Local AI Package**
- The **local AI package** is a key part of Archon's architecture that allows it to operate as a self-contained service:
  - It runs on top of the mCP marketplace and integrates with other services.
  - This package will be essential for version 13, where integration with **Langs Smith** is required.

#### **5. Self-Agent Execution**
- Archon will include support for running agents as subagents directly within the mCP Marketplace:
  - Agents can start execution on their own serverless instance.
  - This feature will make it easier to test and debug agents without leaving the platform.

### **Why This Version?**
This version of archon is designed to be a more complete and powerful architecture that allows for better collaboration between agents. By integrating with multiple services, agents can work together like agents in a marketplace, making them more versatile and effective.

Let me know if you'd like more details about any specific feature or step-by-step guide!
