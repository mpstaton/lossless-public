Alright, let me break down how I approached responding to this user's query. The user was an newcomers at Temple Labs, starting their project with three main options: generating code from a prompt, connecting to an existing GitHub repo, or designing on a blank canvas. They wanted a detailed overview of the app as they begin.

First, I considered why the user is new. Maybe they're not very technical but are interested in building a landing page for a real estate platform. So my response had to cover all three options briefly, focusing on each with their pros and cons.

I started by introducing Temple Labs, explaining it's an app development environment focused on collaboration. That sets the stage for what users can do and why they should choose it.

Next, I broke down the three routes. The prompt route is quick but might be vague. Then, connecting to a GitHub repo is great for sharing code but requires some setup. Designing canvas is user-friendly but doesn't generate any app, so I kept that as an option in case they want something simple.

I included a brief mention of AI chat integration which can help with support and changes, making the process smoother. The styling and file selector were important tools for organizing their work, so I highlighted those too.

Finally, I wanted to guide them on how to move forwardâ€”like connecting to GitHub and creating assets for storytelling. This gives a clear path moving from initial planning to development.

Throughout, I made sure to keep it straightforward without getting too technical, ensuring the user feels more confident about starting their project.

Great! Temple Labs is an excellent platform for building applications due to its collaborative design tools and integration with AI chat, among other features. Letâ€™s go through each option briefly:

### 1. **Generate Code from Prompt**
   - This route allows you to create a quick application in seconds by just giving it a prompt.
   - It's great if you need something done quickly or want to test out your ideas without much setup.
   - However, the code generated might be too vague for production use.

### 2. **Connect to Existing GitHub Repo**
   - If you already have some code or design work on a GitHub repo, Temple Labs can help connect them directly with your project.
   - This allows for easy sharing, collaboration, and version control, which is essential if your project will be released to the public.
   - However, this route doesnâ€™t generate any new application unless you generate code from the prompt.

### 3. **Design on a Blank Canvas**
   - If youâ€™re just starting out or want something simple, Temple Labs offers a canvas where you can design your app directly within the browser.
   - Itâ€™s user-friendly and doesnâ€™t require any technical setup.
   - However, this route wonâ€™t generate an application unless you also add functionality to create the actual code.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
- Connect to [your GitHub repo](https://github.com/your-repo) first if you want to share your work with Temple Labs.
- Once deployed, you can decide on a design route (prompt, canvas, or connect to GitHub). The AI chat integration will help keep things going smoothly.

Iâ€™m excited for your journey at Temple Labs! Let me know how it goes. ðŸ˜Š
