Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this prompt the user provided. Let me read through it again: "This is an iterative prompt that will do a quick check in the context window when you first send it over my system prop. If there are any unuse code in agent task, ts, viw, or the name of my file, we'll watch the amount of tokens used and look at the cost. I'm very curious because I've changed my system prop to be more iterative, so I wanted to see how it works on a bigger file like this. Initially, when I fire off my version, it went up to 16k in the context window, but then found some good stuff and did save some content. Now, with this prompt, it's aiming for something like 9 cents compared to what was previously at 35. It removed a lot of garbage and cleaned up a significant number of lines of code, including duplicates or unused code. I'm super excited because this is cutting down my costs so much, but I'm also thinking about the potential downsides. Using M mCP for instance might not be helpful here because it's more about saving time than getting accurate context, which could lead to errors in the system prop settings. So, maybe I should avoid using that and instead focus on creating prompts that are as precise as possible without relying on iterative tools. Also, I'm curious about how this applies across different files. Would a prompt like "Remove unused code" work similarly? Or would it be more effective at something else? I think the key takeaway is that while this prompt can save significant amounts of money, there are trade-offs in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

The provided prompt is designed to optimize system prop settings by leveraging iterative prompts. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Purpose**: It aims to identify unuseable code for efficiency gains, cutting costs significantly.

2. **Iterative Aspect**: The system will perform this check initially, then refine it further when more precise tasks are required.

3. **Expectations**: While effective in reducing costs, using M mCP may not be ideal as it could lead to inaccuracies or errors during prop creation.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Avoid M mCP if iterative tools aren't needed.
   - Use more specific prompts like "Remove unused code" for clarity and effectiveness.
   - Test across various files, focusing on automation where possible.

5. **Considerations**: The user is excited by the savings but should be mindful of potential inaccuracies from non-optimized prompts.
