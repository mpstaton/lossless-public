Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided an article discussing the role of LLMs (like ChatGPT) versus coders, from a very personal perspective. They went through some examples about how LLMs can help create prototypes and run experiments quickly, while coders might struggle with those tasks.

Now, the user is asking me to think through this, possibly for an educational purpose or as part of a discussion group. I need to consider what they're really trying to understand. They seem to be exploring whether LLMs are more helpful or if coders are overemphasized in their roles.

I should break down the key points: how often do coders struggle with tasks that LLMs can handle faster? Are there any examples where coders find it hard, or vice versa?

Also, they mention that companies like Meta might face this, implying that while LLMs are great for certain tasks, others require human expertise. This makes sense because different problems need different skills.

I should structure my thoughts based on these points, perhaps categorizing them into examples where coders struggle and where they succeed with LLMs. Then, I can discuss the implications for roles in tech companies, especially focusing on medium to small businesses vs. large corporations.

Wait, the user also included some emojis like ü§∏‚ôÇÔ∏è which might indicate a more personal or enthusiastic tone. They want me to think about this and provide an analysis, so I should make sure my response is thorough but not too lengthy, keeping it concise yet informative.

I need to ensure that my thoughts flow logically from examples of coders struggling with LLMs tasks, then where they excel, and finally the implications for different roles in tech companies. Maybe also touch on why some people are skeptical or overly excited about LLMs, which could be a point of contention among others.

Let me make sure I cover all these aspects without getting too technical, keeping it relatable by using the personal examples provided. That should help the user understand the dynamics between coders and LLMs in various roles.

It seems like you're exploring whether LLMs (like ChatGPT) are more helpful or if coders are overemphasized in their roles within tech companies. This is a very personal and subjective perspective, so it's important to approach the discussion with empathy and understanding of how individuals feel about these differing experiences.

### Key Points from Your Thought Process:

1. **Coders Struggling with LLMs**:
   - Many coders find tasks that LLMs can handle faster challenging. For example, creating a prototype or running an experiment without coding might take longer.
   - Some coders struggle to replicate the creativity and complexity of LLM outputs, especially when it comes to understanding domain knowledge.

2. **Coders succeeding with LLMs**:
   - In scenarios where the task requires deep understanding of the problem (e.g., debugging issues in legacy code or securing environments), coders can leverage their expertise more effectively.
   - LLMs are particularly useful for generating initial ideas, suggesting solutions, and providing insights that a coder might not have access to.

3. **Implications for Tech Companies**:
   - While LLMs offer significant benefits (e.g., faster experimentation, prototyping), they don't replace coders entirely.
   - Companies like Meta may face challenges in transitioning to AI-driven practices, as coders are often seen as "no-code" experts.

4. **Why Some People Are Sceptical**:
   - The belief that LLMs "do nothing for me" might stem from the idea that they don't have personal experience with programming or problem-solving.
   - Coders' uncertainty could be due to a lack of awareness about how AI can complement their skills.

### Conclusion:

Both coders and LLMs have their strengths, but neither is entirely superior. The role of each depends on the context and what you're trying to achieve. In tech companies, especially for medium to small-sized businesses, coders are often more valuable due to their hands-on experience and ability to apply knowledge in real-world scenarios. However, LLMs can accelerate tasks that require creativity or domain understanding.

Ultimately, the decision to use whom for a particular role depends on your skills, interests, and how you see yourself contributing to the company's goals.
