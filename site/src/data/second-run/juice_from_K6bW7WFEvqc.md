Okay, so I'm trying to understand what's happening with this Doo 2 series. From the information given, they're releasing new versions every few months. The first one was in October. Now we're back at work and working on simplifying programming. They've got a new release called Dino, which is packed with web assembly stuff.

Wait, what's WebAssembly? I know it's a technology that allows programs to run in the browser without needing its own server or runtime environment. So, using WebAssembly can make things faster because the code doesn't have to be compiled into regular binary files. That makes sense for running games or apps on the web.

So, Dino is all about importing and compiling modules written in WebAssembly. They mention that WebAssembly modules become part of a module graph, which means they can analyze how to use them optimally. It sounds like this allows for better optimization and faster execution because the compiler knows exactly where things should go without needing to load each piece individually.

They also talk about WebAssembly being a binary compilation target. That makes sense because it's already used in games like Unity or Unreal Engine, which rely on their WebAssembly features. By compiling modules into binaries, they can take advantage of WebAssembly's performance benefits while still allowing for some user interaction through the browser.

Dino has always had WebAssembly support and now is adding this new major release. The first long-term support release means it will be around longer. They mention that Dino gets a new minor release every six weeks, which probably helps with updates without disrupting current projects. Plus, they have a patch release almost every week, so there's always something new to work on.

The team in larger organizations is used to these releases before production, but this fast-paced release makes it challenging for them to keep up quickly. To make things easier for production use, Dino is releasing the first Long-Term Support Release (LTS) today, 21 Branch. I'm guessing this will have important bug fixes and performance improvements over the next six months.

There are some cool features in release 21. First off, managing JavaScript and npm dependencies with a new command called dino outdated. This sounds like it will help users update packages more easily, especially if they're using multiple tools or frameworks that rely on Dino's WebAssembly support. I think this is going to be super helpful for teams working with different environments.

Another feature is the ability to embed additional files into compiled programs through an include flag. That means you can add your own custom code without having to modify the Dino source files too much, which sounds like a game-changer for projects that need more flexibility.

Also, using WebAssembly's caching feature on startup will speed up development because it caches the binary executable after the first run. This should make testing and debugging faster, especially if teams use these programs in interactive environments where they might have permission prompts to check their jobs.

The user mentioned an improvement over previous versions with WebAssembly modules. They can now include arbitrary files using a major overhaul of Dino's internal infrastructure. This probably means that existing users don't have to worry about running into issues when adding new files, which could save a lot of time and effort.

Debugging in release 21 is also simpler thanks to Tech traces, which track permission requests and where they came from. By enabling these, developers can more easily pinpoint exactly where permissions are needed for their programs. This will help fix bugs faster because it makes debugging more straightforward.

There's a new feature called Stack traces when running programs with the doot Trace permission environment variable. This allows teams to see precisely where each part of the program is requesting a certain permission, making it easier to understand and correct any issues related to permissions.

They also mention that Dino can leverage V8 code caching for startup speedup. Since WebAssembly uses V8 optimizations under the hood, this feature will help compile programs faster by reusing cached binaries. This should reduce build times significantly, especially for new projects.

Lastly, they said that in release 21, commonjs support is added to Dino. So, if a project is using CommonJS and needs WebAssembly features, it can now be supported through Dino. This will bridge the gap between different tools and frameworks, making development easier across various environments.

Overall, this seems like a major step forward for Dino, especially considering its target audience of WebAssembly developers. By integrating WebAssembly into traditional browsers, they're taking an already popular technology and making it more accessible to a broader range of projects and users. This should open up even more possibilities for people working with web-based applications that could benefit from WebAssembly's performance improvements.
