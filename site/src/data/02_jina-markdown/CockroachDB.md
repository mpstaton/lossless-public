Scale to meet demand
--------------------

Avoid database slowdowns that hinder your business growth. CockroachDB eliminates manual sharding, allowing your database to expand seamlessly as your workload grows.

### SQL that scales horizontally

Experience a unified database system without the hassle of managing separate shards. Easily increase your database's reading and writing capabilities by adding more nodes as needed.

[Learn more](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview)

### Built for transaction-heavy (OLTP) workloads

CockroachDB speaks standard SQL and supports distributed, ACID-compliant transactions. Always know your data remains immediately correct — even as you scale.

[Learn more](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions)

![Image 26: quote-bg](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F00voh0j35590%2F1LmB7JdvU1OGfYsxkLMO5Z%2F5a6c686671ae562c2bc5c37d98b3a286%2Fquote-bg.png&w=1920&q=75)

CockroachDB has support for distributed transactions and multiple regions by default, which is what we are looking for because it makes it more reliable and scalable out of the box.

Highly available by design
--------------------------

Help ensure your essential applications stay online, even during cloud outages or updates. Maintain uninterrupted service for your customers, safeguarding your revenue.

### No database downtime

CockroachDB continues to serve queries even when nodes, availability zones, and even entire regions fail. Perform maintenance — like online schema changes and rolling upgrades — without disrupting the customer experience.

[Learn more](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cluster-management)

### Multi-active availability

With a multi-active architecture, you can take full advantage of your hardware; every machine can serve both reads and writes. You can tolerate failures without compromising availability. Unlike other availability designs, CockroachDB guarantees data consistency via consensus replication and allows you to achieve zero RPO / RTO.

![Image 28: quote-bg](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F00voh0j35590%2F1LmB7JdvU1OGfYsxkLMO5Z%2F5a6c686671ae562c2bc5c37d98b3a286%2Fquote-bg.png&w=1920&q=75)

One of the biggest things that surprised me about CockroachDB is that replication is not a problem anymore. It’s actually a solved problem.

— James Lupolt, Database Engineer @ Hard Rock Digital

Control data placement and latency
----------------------------------

Deploy your application across various regions and cloud platforms. Decide where your data lives to provide fast, responsive experiences for all your customers.

### Multi-region, multi-cloud deployments

CockroachDB adapts to your needs, operating on any cloud setup or on-site infrastructure. Move your apps and data freely between environments to meet regulations and prevent being tied to a single provider.

[Learn more](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/multiregion-overview)

### Put data in its place

Position data near your users to speed up access times. CockroachDB's customizable data placement policies help you comply with regulations and keep data where it needs to be.

[Learn more](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/multiregion-overview)

![Image 30: quote-bg](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F00voh0j35590%2F1LmB7JdvU1OGfYsxkLMO5Z%2F5a6c686671ae562c2bc5c37d98b3a286%2Fquote-bg.png&w=1920&q=75)

CockroachDB is a good fit for storing customer metadata because it provides reliable and low latency access. No matter where the customer lives… We love that CockroachDB just works and solves a very difficult problem.

— David Phillips, CTO @ Starburst

### Operate efficiently in the cloud

The secure, fully managed CockroachDB cloud platform virtually eliminates manual database operations and enables superior economics. Reallocate your technical talent to focus on feature development that fuels growth and reduces risky technical debt.

[See how](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/do-more-with-less-with-distributed-sql/)

### Faster, smoother migrations

Running PostgreSQL-compatible CockroachDB means you can migrate existing applications and services quickly. And the MOLT Live migration tool simplifies the end-to-end migration lifecycle.

[See how](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/migration-overview)

![Image 32: quote-bg](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F00voh0j35590%2F1LmB7JdvU1OGfYsxkLMO5Z%2F5a6c686671ae562c2bc5c37d98b3a286%2Fquote-bg.png&w=1920&q=75)

The migration process has gone on without a hitch. CockroachDB is extremely resilient and has been much easier to manage. It provides monitoring and alerting, rolling upgrades and other features that have lowered maintenance. We’ve actually upgraded several times through the process and it’s been seamless.
