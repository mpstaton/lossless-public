Okay, let me break down how I approached this user's query about Temple Labs. First, I saw the initial welcome message from Temple Labs. It had three routes for starting projects: generating a landing page from a prompt, connecting to an existing GitHub repo, or designing on a blank canvas.

I decided to start with the first route since it was clear—building a landing page for a real estate platform. I made sure to highlight that we can either generate this directly in tempo or connect to an existing repo. It's important to mention these options so users know their choices are available.

Next, looking at the flow of how the project would develop, I wanted to show a smooth progression. So, after generating the initial PRD, I included steps to enhance the design with tools like styling, asset selection, and interactive elements. This helps in making sure the team is on board from the start.

I also thought about future steps, mentioning the design system builder and superbase integration. These are key features that would add more functionality as the project grows. Additionally, showing how to clone assets and manage history was important for maintaining a consistent workflow.

Throughout this process, I kept the language simple and encouraging, making sure users feel comfortable starting right away without any technical jargon. The emphasis on collaboration with AI chat made it easier for them to ask questions if needed. Overall, my goal was to create a clear, actionable plan that guides the team from the start to successful deployment of their project.

Great! Let’s break this down step-by-step based on the flow you’ve described:

---

### **1. Starting Point**
- Go to **[Temple Labs]** and click on the logo (or use the "New Design" button if available).
- From the top dropdown, choose:
  - Generate a new project directly in Temple.
  - Connect to an existing design.

---

### **2. Initial Steps: Generating Your Landing Page**
1. **Generate Your First PRD**:
   - Click on the **[Generate Project] button** (or use your navigation bar).
   - In the browser, create or paste your landing page content into a new tab.
   - Save your work and return to Temple.

2. **Enhance Your Design**:
   - Once your PRD is ready, you can improve it by:
     - Adding styling tools: Use the **[Design Tools] button** (or use your navigation bar) to access your styling options.
     - Select assets from your repository:
       - Go to **[Asset Manager]** and click on **[New Asset]**.
       - Choose a domain name that is relevant to your project (e.g., `real-estate-labs.com`).
       - Click **[Upload File] and enter the content for your asset.**
     - Create interactive elements:
       - Use **[Draw Tool]** (found in **[Asset Manager]**) to create diagrams, maps, or buttons.
       - Add features like a "Copy Property Listing" button by using the AI chat during this process.

---

### **3. Collaborative Design and Collaboration**
- **Use your AI chat**:
  - After generating your initial PRD, you can use Temple’s AI chat to collaborate with your team on improving the design.
  - Ask questions about content clarity, functionality, or any issues that arise.
  
- **Share your work**:
  - Once your PRD is complete, copy it and paste it into the AI chat for feedback.
  - Use the chat function in Temple to share your findings with the team.

---

### **4. Building Features**
Once you’ve completed your initial design, you can start building features:

- **Clone Assets**:
  - Click on a property listing in your PRD and use the **[Copy Asset] button**.
  - This allows you to work independently on that asset while maintaining access to the entire project.

- **Manage History**:
  - Use Temple’s workflow tools (found in the top menu bar) to manage changes to your assets and projects. 
  - You can create a history of changes, assign tasks to team members, or track progress over time.

---

### **5. Final Steps**
- After completing all required features, you’ll have a fully functional landing page ready for deployment.
- Use Temple’s deploy button (or the "New Design" button) to create your final version and share it with stakeholders.
  - Once deployed, you can manage reviews and feedback by following the links in your PRD.

---

### **Summary**
Start with generating your initial project, then enhance it using styling tools. Collaborate with your team to improve the design, clone assets, and build features while managing history. This structured approach ensures smooth collaboration from the start!
