Alright, so I'm trying to understand this whole AI and fake AI thing. It sounds like a lot of people are talking about companies renaming their names to keep their "AI" status, thinking it'll make them more valuable. But wait, isn't that kind of the old way they tried to sell things? Like, if you had a logo with a word that meant something, people would think they were selling a product. So maybe renaming is not giving anything in return?

The article mentions the SEC warning about name changes affecting stock prices and trading volume. It seems like companies that changed their names during certain periods saw higher stock prices and more trading. I wonder how significant that effect was compared to actual company performance.

Also, there's a mention of something called "beta" and "momentum." Beta measures how much the stock price moves with the market, right? If a company's stock has a high beta, it tends to be more volatile. Momentum is when companies with increasing sales tend to have higher prices. So maybe renaming doesn't really affect those factors.

The article even points out that real AI companies didn't show the same kind of returns as these renamed names. That suggests that renaming isn't giving any better value than actual companies. Maybe it's just a coincidence or something random.

I'm also thinking about how companies with fake names might have used them for marketing purposes, like in ads or viral videos. If they're not actually trying to sell AI technology, then maybe the renaming is more about making money from name changes than from any actual product or service.

So putting it all together, renaming isn't really helping these companies. It's just a way to make money, but if the real value comes from their actual products and services, this approach won't work. Maybe AI technology itself could be the answer here, something that doesn't require renaming names.

I'm still a bit confused about why people are even going through all this renaming business in the first place. Wasn't there already some companies trying to sell AI as a product? It seems like renaming is just an economic tool they use to get their names out of the way and make money, but it's not giving them any real advantage.

Maybe in the end, if AI becomes more prevalent than I think it is, there could be a better way for companies to market their products without relying on renaming. But right now, renaming seems like a dead end. So perhaps the focus should shift to actual innovation and product development rather than just trying to hide behind renaming names.

The approach of renaming company names to "AI" is an economic strategy aimed at generating quick returns through name changes, which can increase stock prices and trading volume. However, this strategy does not provide genuine value as it coincidentally correlates with real or potential AI companies' performance. The SEC warning about name effects on stock returns suggests that while some renamed names saw higher values, these are due to coincidental market movements rather than actual company benefits.

Key points to consider:

1. **Economic Strategy**: Renaming was used to capitalize on the popularity of the term "AI," treating it like a product name. While successful, it does not provide real advantage for investors.

2. **Beta and Momentum Analysis**: The article highlights that renamed names did not affect beta (market movement) or momentum (sales growth), indicating they were not giving value beyond their current roles.

3. **Real vs. Fake Names**: Companies with fake names may have used them in marketing, but this does not enhance market perception for AI technology itself.

4. **Potential Future of AI**: If AI becomes a mainstream technology, it might emerge as an innovative product rather than relying on renaming names, offering real value without the benefits of name manipulation.

Conclusion: While renaming was effective during its time, it is an outdated strategy not providing genuine advantage. Focused innovation and product development may yield better returns in the future if AI emerges as a standard technology.
