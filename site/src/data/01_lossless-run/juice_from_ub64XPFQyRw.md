Alright, so I've just watched this video about Code LLM, which is a tool similar to AI IDEs like Wind Surf or Cursor. The person explained that Code LLM helps with building out apps by analyzing intents and traversing codebases. They mentioned Sonet 3.7 and Haku 3.5 for development but also talked about 3.7 thinking, which I'm not entirely sure how that works yet.

The video started with a simple Next.js project where they used the agent to change text on a homepage. It showed how the AI can analyze intents like "find developers digest" and then modify the text as needed. They demonstrated it by changing lines 94-95, which probably involved replacing some content or adding/removing parts.

Then, after that example, they moved on to creating an AI arcade page where they added a fun game with cars and neon city effects. The user wanted to explore this further but only went up to setting up the navigation without any of the code LLM features yet. They noted that even earlier when they used CS2, they didn't have these capabilities.

I'm curious about how exactly the AI agent works. Do they scan the entire codebase or just specific sections? Also, how does 3.7 thinking play into this? I wonder if it's like the person mentioned before being able to think about larger projects beyond just files.

The user also added a game for the homepage but didn't go far with that yet. They wanted more details on how they can implement their own projects or build something themselves, which makes me think of how versatile this tool could be for different types of applications and games.

I'm interested in knowing if there are any limitations to Code LLM. Are there cases where it might not function well? Also, how does the rate limit work? Is it per month, and how much of a discount is that compared to using CS2?

Overall, this seems like a cool tool for developers and game creators alike. It's supposed to make building apps faster by leveraging AI, but I'm still not entirely clear on all its capabilities yet. Maybe next time I check out the video, they'll explain more about 3.7 thinking and how it can be applied beyond just code editing.

The video introduced Code LLM as a tool that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance development processes, particularly for building applications and games. It highlighted features like Sonet 3.7 and Haku 3.5, which are part of the agent's capabilities. The user demonstrated its application in modifying text on a homepage by analyzing intents, such as "find developers digest," and adjusting specific lines.

The AI agent also supports traversal of codebases through a game-like interface, allowing users to navigate menus or projects by answering questions. It mentioned 3.7 thinking, which suggests it can consider larger project contexts beyond individual files.

In the video, the user focused on creating an AI arcade page with a fun game featuring cars and neon city effects. They noted that while they completed the navigation setup, there was room for expansion in further development. The video aimed to encourage users to explore Code LLM, offering insights into its versatility as a tool for developers and game creators.

The user highlighted the potential benefits of this tool, emphasizing how it could accelerate app development by AI-driven analysis. They also posed questions about limitations and rate plans, inviting exploration for deeper understanding.
