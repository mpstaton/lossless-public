Okay, let me try to figure out how to help this user. They've been talking about learning deep technical concepts like AI and programming from scratch, and they've hit some roadblocks or questions that have made them confused. It seems like they're struggling with understanding how these advanced topics work in real-world applications. Maybe they're looking for practical examples or analogies that can make the abstract ideas more concrete.

I should acknowledge their effort so far, showing that I'm here to help. Then, suggest breaking down complex concepts into simpler parts. Perhaps starting with everyday experiences where AI and deep learning are used could make it relatable. Also, talking about how these technologies are evolving quickly might give them a sense of hope or excitement about the future.

I need to avoid being too technical in my answers because that might confuse them further. Maybe using analogies like comparing learning programming to solving jigsaw puzzles with pieces getting smaller each time could work well. That way, they can see how each step brings them closer to mastery without feeling overwhelmed by numbers.

Additionally, encouraging active engagement through projects or discussions might help them apply what they're learning. It's important to highlight the importance of practice and consistency in mastering these subjects. I should also remind them about community support and resources like online forums or local groups where they can ask questions if they get stuck.

Overall, balancing technical explanations with relatable examples and encouragement will address their underlying concerns and help them feel more confident moving forward.

It sounds like you're diving deep into topics that are fascinating but challenging. Here's a breakdown of your thoughts so far:

1. **AI and Deep Learning**: AI is about machines learning from data, while deep learning specifically refers to neural networks trained on large datasets. Both are evolving rapidly, and they play a crucial role in various industries today.

2. **PhD vs. Engineering**: There might be some confusion here between academic degrees (phD) and professional roles (engineering). While phD is a definitive level of education, in the context of learning these technologies, it's more about understanding their principles and applications rather than being classified as an engineer or a technical expert.

3. **Learning from Scratch**: Building foundational knowledge on your own can be tough, but it's a great way to understand the mechanics behind AI and deep learning. It’s important to practice regularly and engage with the material actively.

If you're looking for practical examples or analogies, here are some ideas:

- **Everyday Applications**: Think about how AI is used in common technologies like recommendation engines on Netflix or Google Search's search algorithm. These are real-world applications that make your studies more relevant.

- **Puzzle Analogy**: Just as solving a jigsaw puzzle requires small pieces to be put together, learning deep learning involves understanding individual neurons and neural networks working together. Each layer adds another level of detail, much like adding another piece to the puzzle.

- **Iterative Learning**: The AI training process is iterative—the model improves with each iteration over time. This "trial and error" approach can help you see how these technologies work in practice.

If you're still struggling with specific concepts or projects, don't hesitate to reach out for more detailed explanations. Building a strong foundation is key, and consistent effort will pay off in the long run!
