Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has provided a YouTube video description about their Proximock full server guide walkthrough. They want me to imagine myself as the end-user interacting with my thought process while solving their problem.

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. They might be looking for tips or steps on setting up and using Proximock's full backend features. Maybe they have a specific issue in mind, like backup time, data security, or configuration challenges.

Looking at the video description, it covers several key areas: installation, backups, file system setup, backup retention, and troubleshooting. It also includes recommendations for buying drives from ServerPart.deals.com with warranties and affiliate links.

I should consider if there's anything in the description that stands out or if I missed any important points. For example, I see they mention a month-long backup period, so it's crucial to emphasize how much time that adds. Also, their approach seems thorough, which is great for someone new to Proximock.

I should structure my thought process by identifying the main points: installation steps, backups, file system setup, retention options, and troubleshooting tips. Maybe I can outline how each of these contributes to a smooth backend operation.

Additionally, the user might be looking for alternative methods or ways to optimize their backups beyond what's in the video. Perhaps they're seeking more advanced features or want to ensure their backups are not only done but also secure.

I need to make sure my response is comprehensive, covering all aspects mentioned and offering practical advice without being overwhelming. It should help them feel confident starting Proximock.

   - **Step 2:** Under the “Manage” section, click on “Backup & Recovery.”
   - **Step 3:** Set a backup schedule:
     - Backup every day at 10:00 AM UTC+05:30 (Proximock is in India).
     - Retain backups for up to 2 weeks.
     - Keep the last 5 backups if you want them accessible immediately after a crash.
   - **Step 4:** You can also configure Proximock to backup frequently used drives and systems.

### 3. **File System Setup**
   - **Step 1:** Open Proximock and go to **File > Set Up File System** (or use the on-screen menu).
   - **Step 2:** Choose a file system from ServerPart.deels.com:
     - **Windows/Mac:** UEFI or bootable USB.
     - **Linux:** Use the Linux distribution’s native file system.
   - **Step 3:** Save your configuration to Proximock and restart it for backups.

### 4. **Backup Retention**
   - **Step 1:** Go to **File > backup retention settings** (on Windows/Mac) or use the browser extension.
   - **Step 2:** Set up a backup retention plan:
     - Keep the last 5 backups if you encounter a data loss.

### 5. **Troubleshooting**
   - **Common Issues:**

### 6. **Additional Tips**
   - **Backup Size:** Proximock automatically backs up large files, so you’ll rarely need to manually adjust your backup size.
   - **Ways to Optimize Backups:**
     - Set up auto-backup for frequently used directories.
