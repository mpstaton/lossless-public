Okay, so I'm going to be showing off a YouTube video about God mode. The user is talking about how this AI chat browser allows them to access multiple LLMs all in one interface using global command buttons. They mention things like Perplexity, Bard, and Llama 70B/13B. 

First, I need to understand what God mode actually does. From the description, it's a new browser that lets you quickly get started with various AI chat applications by just typing prompts in one place. So if someone starts a message like "how far is the sun?", the response comes up automatically from different apps.

The user talked about the settings they can configure within each application. For example, selecting Llama 13B on Perplexity requires a GPT+ or Plus tier account and using the "Off to the Races" button. They also mentioned that having multiple apps side by side with different features makes it easy to manage.

Now, I should consider what the user might be asking about. Maybe they want to know how to use God mode effectively, troubleshoot common issues, or learn more about its features and limitations. Since they asked for a video explaining this, perhaps they're looking for step-by-step instructions on setting up their first app or troubleshooting any problems that come up.

I should think about what aspects are important here: installation steps, configuration options within each provider, global command buttons, account settings, and any potential issues like access controls. Also, maybe touch on the benefits of this tool compared to traditional LLMs and how it streamlines the user experience with multiple apps in one place.

I should make sure the explanation is clear and covers both the basics of using God mode and the deeper features that might be useful for users looking to explore different AI options without switching platforms each time.

Got a question about using God mode? Let's break it down step by step. First, you'll need to download the DMG file from GitHub. Here's how:

1. **Download**: Click on [GitHub link](https://github.com/DEMONAI/God-mode) and install the latest version.

2. **Login**: Log into one of the LLM providers (Hugging Face, Poornja, Bard, etc.) using your account details.

3. **Access God Mode**:
   - Click on "Command Shift G" from any app to open a command line.
   - Type your prompt and press Enter or click "Command Enter." The response will appear in the browser.

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Select an LLM provider (e.g., Llama 70B) by navigating through God mode's settings, ensuring you have the necessary account tier.
   - Adjust any customizations for your specific use case before accessing an app.

5. **Troubleshooting**: Be mindful of access controls and ensure you're only using apps under legitimate accounts.

God mode streamlines AI experience with multiple apps side by side, making configuration easier. It's a great tool for exploring different LLMs without platform switching.
