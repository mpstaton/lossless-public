Okay, so I just came across this really interesting discussion about SAS software and how it's going down. The user mentioned something about agents or agentic systems being dead because of Microsoft's CEO, Sati, who talked about how application software is at a point of transformational change. He said that as long as the software we use today disappears and gets replaced by these AI-driven systems, SAS isn't actually dead.

First, I need to understand what agents or agentic systems are. From what I know, an agent is like a smart software tool that can interact with the outside world, learn from data, and make decisions on its own. It's not just about solving a problem for you; it can plan, adapt, and even back track if something goes wrong.

So, if SAS isn't dead because of agents, what's happening? The user provided an example where Microsoft used an agent to build software with a free account, allowing users to create custom PDF mergers without paying monthly fees. This seems like a big deal because it means companies can develop their own tools without spending money on expensive subscriptions.

But why does this matter for SAS? Well, SAS is the original software company in the US, right? So if they're still around, maybe they just continue to offer services as before. But the user thinks that with more AI agents and automation, the market might shift away from traditional SAS tools because people can handle their own stuff.

I'm thinking about how this affects the future of software development. If agents are so powerful and can create everything on their own, why would SAS still be a dominant player? Maybe it's just that the need for specialized software is decreasing as more businesses rely on AI-driven solutions instead.

Also, I wonder if there will ever be a time when traditional software tools like SAS become obsolete because of these agents taking over. That could change how industries work and might require some changes in how they develop and distribute software.

I'm curious about the implications for developers who use SAS. If it's still around, would that mean more people are familiar with it? Or maybe they're doing so much without needing it that they don't feel the need to learn about agents anymore?

The user mentioned Nat talking about flexibility and reliability. They can create software on the fly but there might be times when it's not reliable or unpredictable. This could be a concern for businesses that rely heavily on SAS because their systems would suddenly become inconsistent.

Overall, I think this is shifting towards more AI-driven solutions being the norm rather than traditional software. It's exciting but also worrying about how industries adapt and whether traditional tools will still play a role.

The discussion highlights a fascinating shift in technology where application software, particularly through agents or agentic systems, becomes the dominant force as AI emerges to replace costly subscriptions. Here are the key points:

1. **Agents and Agentic Systems**: These intelligent software tools can interact with external data, plan solutions, and adapt without direct programming. They replace traditional problem-solving in software.

2. **Microsoft's Example**: Microsoft used an agent to build free software for PDF mergers, showing how AI can provide customized, on-the-fly solutions without subscriptions.

3. **Impact on SAS**: While SAS continues to operate, its role might diminish as more businesses embrace AI-driven tools. This could affect developers who use it, potentially requiring fewer learning steps or being less reliant on traditional software.

4. **Future Shifts**: The shift towards AI suggests a reevaluation of software development and distribution. More flexible, adaptable systems will likely dominate, possibly altering how industries structure their software ecosystems.

5. **Concerns for Traditional Tools**: Businesses relying on SAS might find their systems inconsistent if agents become the norm. This could lead to adjustments in how they develop and distribute software, potentially making traditional tools less essential.

Overall, while this is exciting, it raises questions about industry adaptation and the role of traditional software in a future dominated by AI-driven solutions.
