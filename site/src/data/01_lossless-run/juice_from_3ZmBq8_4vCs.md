Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to set up a flow that allows me to build a todo list app. The user mentioned something about using sequential agents and some nodes, but I'm not entirely sure how all these pieces fit together. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, I know that in a todo list app, users typically add tasks like "Create a new task" or "Update an existing task." When the task is completed, it gets marked as done and removed from the list. The supervisor usually checks if all tasks are done before proceeding.

The user talked about sequential agents, which I think are nodes that can remember previous interactions with other nodes in the flow. That makes sense because the supervisor needs to make decisions based on past messages or data. So maybe each agent handles different parts of the process—like the supervisor adds a task, the code reviewer reviews it, and then summarizes everything.

Looking at the previous explanation, they mentioned using two agents: one for adding tasks and another for reviewing. Each has an end state where if their respective outputs don't meet the criteria (like not being code or software developer), they trigger the end state to complete. Then, a summary node combines all messages into a single summary.

But wait, in this case, I'm building my own todo list app, so maybe I need to adjust some parts. Let's see:

1. **Adding Tasks**: The supervisor should add new tasks to the list. This could be done with a "New Task" agent. When it adds a task, it should output something like "Add 'Task Name' and set it as active."

2. **Reviewing Tasks**: After adding a task, the code reviewer should review and provide feedback. The supervisor needs to receive this feedback and then either complete the task or prompt the code reviewer to do another task.

3. **Summarizing**: Once all tasks are reviewed, a summary node should generate an overall status of the todo list—like "All tasks done" or "Some tasks incomplete."

4. **Handling End**: If no tasks remain active after summarization, the supervisor can call this as an end to check if everything is completed.

I also noticed in the previous explanation that each agent had a system prompt for their specific role. For example, the code reviewer's system prompt would be different from the supervisor's. This makes sense because they handle different parts of the process.

But I'm not sure how exactly the supervisors and agents interact. How does the flow decide which node to call next? Maybe it's based on some predefined rules or conditions that are set up in each agent. Also, how do I ensure that tasks are completed before any summary happens?

Another thing is handling feedback from the code reviewer. It might be good to have a way for the supervisor to see if there were no issues with the task. Maybe adding another node to check the review message and trigger completion based on its content.

I'm also wondering about the flow structure. Does each agent run in sequence? Like, does the supervisor add a task, then the code reviewer reviews it, and then the summary node runs after that? That seems logical because tasks should be reviewed before summarization is done.

Also, I need to consider how messages are handled. Messages from different nodes shouldn't interfere with each other unless necessary. For example, if one agent adds a task and another is reviewing it, they might get interrupted. Maybe having some synchronization mechanism would help keep the flow organized.

Another consideration is edge cases. What if someone enters invalid tasks or tries to add a non-functional thing? How should the supervisor handle that? Perhaps adding error handling nodes or showing an error message when an invalid task is added.

I'm also thinking about how this would scale. If I have many users, would each user's list be handled separately, or do they share some common state across their lists? It might make sense for them to share some info if possible, but it could get complicated with too much data.

Maybe in this case, since we're building a todo list app, each user can have their own list. So the flow would process one task at a time without interfering with other users' tasks. That makes the app per-user, which is standard for todo lists.

I should also consider how to visualize this flow. Maybe using a visual flowchart tool or a tool that allows me to see each node and its properties clearly. This way, I can better understand how each part of the process interacts with the others and verify if everything works as expected.

Lastly, testing is important. I'll need to test different scenarios: adding a task with feedback completed immediately, tasks requiring multiple iterations (like the supervisor's loop), or even invalid inputs. Each test will help ensure that my flow handles various edge cases correctly and doesn't break when things go wrong.

In summary, building this todo list app involves setting up sequential agents for each role—supervisor, code reviewer, summarization—and ensuring that messages are handled properly between them. I'll need to define system prompts for each agent, manage the flow's decision-making process, handle edge cases, and test various scenarios to make sure everything works smoothly.

To build a todo list app using sequential agents, follow these steps:

1. **Define Roles**:
   - **Supervisor Agent**: Handles adding tasks and completing them.
   - **Code Reviewer Agent**: Reviews tasks for feedback.
   - **Summary Agent**: Summarizes task reviews.

2. **Set Up System Prompts**:
   - Each agent should have a system prompt tailored to its role (e.g., "Complete the 'Create a new task' message" for the supervisor).

3. **Flow Structure**:
   - **Task Addition**: The supervisor adds a task with an output like "Add 'Task Name'".
   - **Review and Feedback**: The code reviewer reviews the task, providing feedback or comments.
   - **Message Handling**: Messages from different agents are managed without interfering unless necessary.
   - **Completion Check**: After summarization, check for completed tasks.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Add error handling nodes to manage invalid tasks or messages.
   - Implement synchronization mechanisms if multiple users are involved.

5. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - Ensure each user has their own todo list (per-user) and allow independent processing without interference.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test various scenarios, including immediate completion of a task, loops with supervisor's loop, and invalid inputs.
   - Use visualization tools to clearly see flow interactions between nodes.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear explanations of each node's role, system prompts, and message handling rules for better understanding and maintenance.

By following these steps, you can create an efficient todo list app using sequential agents, ensuring smooth operation with proper message handling and decision-making processes.
