Alright, I just saw this user's video about tutorials being dead because of Google AI Studio. They were pretty disappointed and then got into some practical examples using Excel, Photoshop, and AWS. Hmm, I remember they even used AI Studio themselves, which is interesting.

First off, the video starts with a heads-up about Google AI Studio, emphasizing the need to be cautious because of how data is used for training models. They're worried about privacy and potentially replacing them entirely since it's all tied to tutorials on YouTube. That makes sense because they can control every step of their experience through this tool.

The user then goes into three different scenarios: Excel, Photoshop, and AWS. Each one has its own set of steps they took in the tool. For Excel, they mentioned setting up a spreadsheet for budget tracking using formulas to make it dynamic. That's pretty neat because it shows how AI can automate parts of their tasks.

In Photoshop, they used curve adjustments and curves on the interface to enhance image details. They also tried adding a private backend with a VPC and database, which is something I hadn't considered before but makes sense since you want your work accessible only from outside the network. This could be really useful for developers or anyone who needs their projects to be public.

For AWS, they were on cloudify where I think they used elastic Beanstalk as a front-end service and an Amazon VPC with private subnets for backend. That's definitely a solid setup because it allows them to control access from anywhere outside the network, which is perfect for something like data processing or API development. They even walked through setting up a VPC and its subnets in detail, which shows their thorough understanding.

I'm impressed by how they used AI Studio here. It's not just about tutorials anymore but also about leveraging these tools to enhance their productivity. The user ended with a thumbs up and a subscription recommendation, which is great for encouraging others to check out the channel too.

Overall, this video is a good example of how AI tools can complement traditional methods by making tasks easier through automation and access control. It's a mix of education on AI applications and practical examples that highlight their effectiveness.

The user's video is an excellent example of how AI tools can complement traditional methods by automating tasks and enhancing productivity, especially when combined with educational content. Here’s a breakdown of the scenarios they demonstrated:

1. **Excel Scenario**:
   - They walked through setting up a dynamic budget tracker using formulas to make their work more efficient.
   - Highlighted the automation aspect, which is a hallmark of AI tools.

2. ** Photoshop Scenario**:
   - Used curve adjustments and built-in curves on the interface to enhance image details.
   - Included steps for creating a multi-tier application with a public front end (elastic Beanstalk) and private backend architecture (Amazon VPC).

3. **AWS Scenario**:
   - Demonstrated setting up cloudify using elastic Beanstalk as a front-end service.
   - Assigned an Amazon VPC with private subnets to handle the backend, including database access.

The video effectively shows how AI tools can be integrated into workflows to automate tasks and enhance accessibility while maintaining control over their use. It’s a practical demonstration of the power of combining traditional software with advanced AI-driven solutions.

Well done!
