Alright, let's break down how NN turned into N8N step by step. Starting with the initial setup where only AI Workflows were available. Then, I added a Workflow ID to connect it to the Weather Tool. This allowed attaching workflows from other tools like N8N. By clicking Save, the workflow became accessible to all users.

When connecting these workflows, the AI agent would switch between tools based on the question asked. For weather-related queries, it used the N8N tool; for non-weather questions, Wikipedia was used. This flexibility made N8N better suited for a variety of tasks compared to other automation platforms.

I tested this by asking different questions—both weather and geography—and observed how each workflow responded. The results confirmed that N8N could handle both types of queries independently, enhancing its versatility beyond just weather data retrieval.

Overall, the transition from AI Workflows to connecting multiple workflows made it more adaptable and powerful for users looking to utilize various tools within the NN platform.

NN (Now called N8N) became a platform where multiple workflows can be connected, allowing users to switch between different tools based on the task at hand. Here's how it worked:

1. **Initial Setup**: Only AI Workflows were available from the start of the platform.

2. **Workflow ID**: A Workflow ID was added to connect NN to other tools like N8N. This allowed attaching workflows from N8N to NN by selecting the workflow ID.

3. **Saving the Workflow**: By clicking "Save," the workflow became accessible to all users, allowing access to its flow and data regardless of where it was saved or stored.

4. **Connecting Workflows**:
   - When a user connected other workflows (e.g., Weather Tool) to NN, they were now part of the same workflow ID.
   - This allowed the AI agent to switch between different tools based on the question asked.

5. **Handling Questions**: For weather-related questions, NN used the N8N tool; for non-weather questions, it used Wikipedia. This flexibility made NN better suited for a variety of tasks compared to other automation platforms.

6. **Testing and Observations**: By asking different questions (e.g., "What's the capital of Spain?"), both weather and geography-related queries were handled independently by N8N. The results confirmed its versatility beyond just weather data retrieval.

In summary, connecting multiple workflows in NN allowed for greater flexibility and adaptability compared to other platforms that were limited to a single tool per user account.
