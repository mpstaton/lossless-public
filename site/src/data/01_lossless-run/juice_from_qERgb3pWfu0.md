Alright, so I'm trying to understand how React works with memory management. From what I gather, React stores data either in arrays or objects, which are stored as primitives in memory. But there's something about comparing by reference versus by value that seems important.

Let me think about this step by step. When you create an array like [1, 2], that takes up some space in memory. If I modify it to be [3, 4], does React recognize that the array has changed? Probably not because arrays are stored as primitives and React compares them by value. So if both are [1, 2] and then one becomes [3, 4], React won't know anything changes.

But what about objects or other data types like strings or numbers? If I have an object {a: 1}, and it changes to {a: 2}, will React detect that the object has changed? Again, probably not because they're primitives. So React only knows if something has changed by reference.

This is important because modifying data in place doesn't affect anything else. For example, if I have a list of names and edit one name while also looking through another section of code, everything stays the same. But that's just an illusion; any change would require re-referencing the object or array.

I'm also thinking about how this affects data management in real applications. If you're managing large datasets where changing one entry requires scanning the whole thing for errors, using references won't help. React would always have to rebuild the entire structure each time something changes, which is inefficient.

So why do we store data as primitives? Maybe it's because creating a new object or array each time isn't efficient. It makes sense in most cases where you're dealing with small datasets and don't need frequent updates unless there are critical dependencies on data.

I wonder how this compares to other languages like Java or C++. In those, objects are strongly typed and their references are used more frequently for state management because it's easier to change the object and have side effects. React's approach is more about immutability, which can be useful in certain contexts but might not be as efficient for dynamic applications.

Another thing I'm thinking about is how this affects debugging or logging. If a variable changes, you need to re-referencing it to see the effect. But with objects and arrays, you could do that by modifying the reference manually instead of React comparing by value each time. That seems more reliable because it's not relying on some external mechanism.

I'm also curious about how this ties into functional programming concepts. In JavaScript, functions are stateless, but they can have side effects. Using React's approach with primitives means you don't have to worry too much about managing references in a way that affects the function's behavior. It keeps things simple and predictable.

But I'm still a bit confused about when it's appropriate to use this. For example, if an object has properties that are not directly related to the application's state, would React automatically know it hasn't changed? No, because they're primitives; React only compares them by value. So you'd need to manually update all their references to reflect any changes in their underlying data.

This makes me think about how React is designed for scenarios where data doesn't change often but needs frequent updates when critical dependencies are involved. It's efficient and straightforward compared to other languages that rely on strong typing and mutable objects.

Overall, I'm trying to get a clearer picture of how React handles memory by comparing references versus values. It seems like the immutability aspect is both an advantage and a potential pitfall depending on how it's used in different contexts.

In React, data storage as primitives (arrays or objects) involves comparison based on value rather than reference. This means:

1. **Arrays/Objects vs Primitives**: Arrays and objects are stored as primitives, so modifying them doesn't trigger React to recognize changes. Only their references change.

2. **Implications of Value Comparison**:
   - Changes in data persist but React doesn't detect updates since they're compared by value.
   - This can lead to inefficiency when frequent updates are required, especially for large datasets or critical applications.

3. **Data Management and Debugging**:
   - Using objects and arrays requires manual updating of their references to reflect changes, ensuring reliable debugging.
   - React's approach avoids relying on external mechanisms for side effects, simplifying debugging.

4. **Comparative Advantages**:
   - Efficient memory usage by avoiding the overhead of managing multiple objects or arrays.
   - Suitable for scenarios with small datasets and predictable updates where data immutability is beneficial.

5. **Considerations in Different Contexts**:
   - Use React's approach for applications requiring frequent updates to maintain state without side effects.
   - Consider alternatives, like strong-typed objects, when dependency management is critical.

In summary, React's primitive storage strategy offers simplicity and efficiency but may require manual reference updates and lacks the flexibility of mutable data structures.
