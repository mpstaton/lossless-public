Okay, I need to create an issue for the typescript repository based on the user's description. The user has set up a monor repo with three main packages: package.json, apps, and two fsfs at the bottom. They're using Turbo as their build tool, configured to cache results (cach false) so it doesn't save intermediate files between builds.

First, I should figure out what the user's primary concern is. They mentioned optimizing dependencies, but more importantly, they've been using typescript for linting and building packages without having to manage that manually because Turbo Dev can handle it. So the issue is about improving the efficiency of the build process when using TSC.

I need to outline why this is important: manual linting and building might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially in a production environment where frequent builds could affect performance. By letting Turbo do the work, users save time and reduce the risk of issues due to incorrect builds.

Now, how can I highlight what's missing or needed in the current setup? The user already has TSC tracking my package so they can reference any scripts from other packages. But perhaps there's more functionality that could be added. Maybe better linting options or improved cache behavior?

I should consider adding features like full version checking with TSL, which would give more context about each file. This would help in finding issues faster if something changes. Also, having a separate cache directory would allow for isolated caching of specific files without affecting other builds.

Another point is the use of pnpm tcr specifically within the apps package. Adding support for different versions or versions based on module dependencies could be useful. Maybe using pnpm version to get a particular version if needed.

I also need to address any technical limitations. The current setup caches all results once, which might not always be ideal. Expanding the cache depth with cach false in turbo can help. Additionally, the use of the pnpm tcr command within apps is quite specific; perhaps offering more flexibility there would make it better.

Lastly, I should explain why this improvement is beneficial for users. It reduces manual intervention, speeds up builds, and helps catch issues earlier because the cache is persistent across multiple builds. This leads to faster deployment and fewer potential bugs.

The issue arises from optimizing the monor repo setup by improving how dependencies are tracked and managed using typescript. The current implementation of `tsc` (Typescript Single Change) on `turbo` has certain limitations that could be enhanced for better efficiency and flexibility.

1. **Linter Support with `tsl`**:
   - Add support for full versioning checks within the apps package using `pnpm tsl`. This would provide more context-aware linting, helping developers quickly identify changes or issues in their codebase.

2. **Enhanced Cache Behavior**:
   - Expand the cache depth of the `turbo` command to reduce cache size and improve performance.
   - Introduce a separate directory for caching specific files (e.g., per-file) to isolate cached results without affecting other builds.

3. **Advanced Versioning with `pnpm tcr`**:
   - Provide more flexibility in using `tcr` (typescript concurrent resolve) within the apps package, allowing users to specify versioning or dependencies on demand.
   - Ensure better support for resolving dependencies across multiple packages and versions.

4. **Cache Management**:
   - Improve cache caching behavior by specifying a deeper cache depth when running `turbo`, ensuring that cached results are only retained as long as necessary.
   - Allow for persistent caching of specific files or modules to avoid interference with other builds or projects.

5. **User-Friendly Command Line Interface**:
   - Ensure the command line interface is more user-friendly and less error-prone, especially when dealing with complex dependencies and large codebases.
   - Add better error handling and logging for `tsc` changes detected during builds.

6. **Linter Integration**:
   - Enhance the linter to handle more common edge cases and provide clearer feedback on linting issues, such as module dependencies or syntax errors that span multiple packages.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Improve the testing framework for `tsc` to ensure that lint checks are accurate and reliable.
   - Add validation steps to verify that all necessary files have been updated when running builds using `tsc`.

By addressing these areas, the monor repo can be optimized for better dependency tracking, linting, and build efficiency. This will help users reduce manual intervention, speed up development, and improve overall productivity.
