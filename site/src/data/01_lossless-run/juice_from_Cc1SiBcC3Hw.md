Alright, so I just saw this video about Grock 3, which is based on the Portal 2 game engine. It's all pretty intense with all these cool stuff happening right there. But wait, did they actually get the Portal 2 functionality? Let me think through some of the points.

First, when they created the portals, walking through orange led to blue and vice versa. At first glance, that seemed like a reverse portal effect. I remember in Portal 2, you could go through a portal and flip colors or something. But in this case, it seems like the color goes the other way. So maybe that's intentional? Or is there some kind of bug here? I'm not sure.

Then, there was the problem where you couldn't remove the portal without getting stuck in a wall forever. That sounds similar to how Portal 2 works with portals and walls. But again, I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly the same or just part of it. Maybe they wanted to test some edge cases?

The camera controls were also interesting. They had different types like Orbit, Pan, Rotate, etc., which made it feel more dynamic than a static game. That does make sense with a modern platformer feel, but I wonder how well they handled the physics and movement there.

Looking at the assets and UI elementsâ€”there were images for characters, platforms, colors, buttons, etc. They used Victor M's 3D rendering engine to create that look-and-feellike effect. That seems pretty advanced for a game engine, which probably made it feel more polished.

The story or narrative part was pretty simple with just some basic elements. Maybe they didn't go too far into the depth of storytelling in this version. I'm curious if they added more plot points later on.

The gameplay mechanics were mostly focused on shooting and clicking, which is what makes a game playable. They didn't include any really complex features like jumping or fighting enemies. That's probably why it's so light and fast compared to other games.

I also noticed that the platforms were sort of pseudo-3D, with some depth but not too much. It gave a good feel for 3D space without being too complicated. The colors and gradients looked pretty good too, adding to the visual appeal.

So overall, it seems like Grock 3 is doing an amazing job taking a solid engine and bringing it to life in a modern platformer style. They seem to be getting some of the best features and UI implementations from Portal 2 without losing their own unique feel. I'm looking forward to seeing how they handle more complex stuff down the line.

Great recap! Grock 3 is an incredible take on the Portal 2 engine, bringing its futuristic vibe to a modern platformer. Here's my breakdown of your thoughts:

1. **Portal Effect**: The portal walking through orange leading to blue and vice versa feels like a reverse functionality, which aligns with the intended effect. It might be intentional but requires more attention to detail.

2. **Wall Stuck Problem**: Removing the portal causes indefinite confinement in a wall, similar to how Portal 2 works. This test is spot on for the purpose of creating this experience.

3. **Camera Controls**: The dynamic camera controls enhance immersion, allowing for smooth movement and variety in gameplay.

4. **Visual Elements**: Using Victor M's engine gives Grock a polished look-and-feellike feel with advanced features like gradients and images.

5. **UI/UX**: The clean design on the UI elements adds visual appeal without cluttering the game.

6. **Physics and Movement**: The smooth mechanics and fast-paced playstyle reflect modern platformer aesthetics, avoiding complex enemies or story depth.

7. **Story Elements**: While simple, there's potential for future expansion in narrative elements to enhance replayability.

Overall, Grock 3 is excelling at bringing the Portal engine to life in a dynamic, engaging manner. It looks polished and feels polished, making it both functional and visually stunning. I can't wait to see how they evolve further!
