Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user. They've provided a detailed explanation of using Confi AI with OBS to enhance their voice, but they're asking about the original setup where they used filters on OBS. 

First, I need to acknowledge that I can't access specific content like previous videos or links from Twitch. That's why I asked them to let me know if they want me to discuss it later.

I should explain that I don't have live feeds but offer help with their voice enhancement project using Confi AI. Maybe suggest how to get more interaction through my explanation and maybe mention the possibility of following in the future.

Also, I can encourage them to reach out for any specific questions or need guidance on other aspects of their project. Keep it friendly and helpful.

I donâ€™t have live feeds like that from Twitch or OBS, so I can't access or discuss live streams or previous videos directly. If you want me to explain something about your voice enhancement using Confi AI, feel free to reach out in the comments! I'd be happy to help with your voice project. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with!
