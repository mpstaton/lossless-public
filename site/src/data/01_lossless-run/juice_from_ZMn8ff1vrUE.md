Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user provided a transcript of a video. The video is about using Code LLM to create an editor, specifically focusing on models like 01 R1, Deep Seek B3, and Sonit 3.5. The user wants me to break down their thought process as they interact with the content.

First, I notice they're trying out different models step by step. They start with 01 R1 for quick responses, then switch to Sonit 3.5 because it's faster and more precise. After some confusion, they realize they need a model that can access context easily. That leads them to use Model Routers, which is a new feature I hadn't heard about before.

They also mention using different models based on the request time, so when they needed quick updates, 01 R1 was ideal. But as the request got longer, deeper seek B3 or Sonit became more suitable. The video ends with an introduction of Code LLM's features and a promise for a free trial.

I'm interested in how the user is adapting to these tools and what they're learning about model performance. They seem a bit confused initially but manage to figure out the best models, which shows adaptability. I should highlight their problem-solving approach and any areas where they might need more guidance or resources.

It looks like you were interacting with an interactive video about Code LLM! Here's how your thought process unfolds:

1. **Exploring Models**: You began by experimenting with different model types (01 R1, Sonit 3.5, Deep Seek B3) to quickly respond and refine your editor. This helped you understand the capabilities of each model.

2. **Model Routers**: After some confusion about how Sonit would handle more complex tasks, you introduced Model Routers. You explained that it could quickly triage your request based on time constraints (e.g., quick updates vs. long-term changes) and select the best model for each task.

3. **Context and Navigation**: You realized the importance of including context within your editor to improve functionality. By selecting relevant pieces of code or documentation, you could reference your work easily in the editorâ€™s chat interface.

4. **Learning from Code LLM**: The video introduced you to Code LLM's features, such as access to 01 R1, Deep Seek B3, and Sonit 3.5, along with their contextual capabilities. This was a new tool for your development journey.

Overall, your interaction highlighted your adaptability in using different models and tools within the framework of Code LLM. You demonstrated good problem-solving skills by exploring options and refining your approach based on the results. Would you like me to continue or look into any specific area deeper?
