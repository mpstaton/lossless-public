Alright, let's break down the user's query. They're asking about some specific SEO tasks using AEM with H's AI features. The user mentioned keyword research is challenging if they don't know where to start. So, I need to figure out how to help them effectively.

First, I should consider their experience level. They seem familiar with AEM and are looking for practical steps to improve their SEO without too much hassle. Maybe they're a new competitor or just starting out in the digital marketing field.

The user provided a detailed outline of tasks like keyword research using the AI feature, content optimization through tools like AEM, localization efforts, and additional AI features. They want me to summarize this information clearly for them.

I need to make sure I address each task step-by-step, providing actionable advice without overwhelming them. It's important to highlight that while they can do some work themselves, using these tools will help them save time and improve efficiency.

Also, the user wants a structured response, so organizing the points logically would be best. Maybe start with keyword research strategies, then move on to content creation, optimization, localization, and finally, suggesting additional AI features for their toolkit.

I should ensure that the language is easy to understand, avoiding too much technical jargon unless necessary. It's also good to leave room for them to ask more questions if they need further clarification.
