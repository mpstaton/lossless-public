Alright, I need to figure out how to deploy a 20 CRM system using Dollar Deploy. Let's start by understanding what each part means.

First, I'll open my browser and go to Dollard deo.com. I'm already logged in to my account, so everything should be set up correctly. Now, I'll scroll through the dashboard on the top right corner. There's a section labeled "Quick Launch App" where I can create a template. I see that I have several templates like "20 CRM - B2B" and others. Since this is for 20 CRM, I'll click on the "20 CRM - B2B" template.

Once I'm in the template section, tap the "Deployment Now" button. This should create a new instance of my 20 CRM system under the Dollar Deploy account. Let me check if the account is active and if there's any existing setup, but it seems like it's just starting with the template.

Next, I'll navigate to the dashboard again on the same screen. Now, under "Billing Details," I see a checkbox next to "Dollar Deploy - 20 CRM." Clicking this will set up billing for my 20 CRM system. I'll tap "Apply" and wait a moment to ensure that the settings are correct.

After the billing is applied, there's a "Next" button that I can tap to proceed with the setup. This should include setting some default values or maybe even creating test data if I haven't set any yet. Once that's done, I'll look for an option like "Tune Settings" or "Final Setup." Maybe it's labeled as "App Information," and from there, I can tweak specific settings to customize my 20 CRM.

Finally, after all setup is done, I'll tap "Commence" or something similar. This should initiate the deployment process, which might take a few minutes depending on my computer's speed. Once it loads, I can either open the app details or just launch it now. If any issues occur during this setup, I can always back up my data before proceeding.

I think that covers all the steps as per what was shown in the video. Hopefully, everything works smoothly without any errors.
