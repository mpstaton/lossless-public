Okay, I'm looking at this video about DeepSeek. So, the user is talking about how DeepSeek can be used for automating business processes by processing large volumes of transaction data. They start by explaining that they've done something similar before with DeepSeek and now want to show a real-life example in part two.

The main goal here is to extract vendor names, amounts, and other details from credit card statements. The user provides an example where the currency isn't clearly determined, which leads them to mention that Safeguard steps are needed. They also note that DeepSeek has some limitations like losing context faster or handling files less effectively compared to other models.

The user is encouraging others to see more of this content and asks if they want more examples. So, I'm thinking about what specific details we can cover in the next demo. Maybe comparing it to another model like GPT-4, discussing the downsides briefly before diving into some structured steps with DeepSeek.

I should make sure my response is clear, concise, and helpful, guiding them on how to expand their demo effectively. I'll mention the limitations of DeepSeek as a cautionary note but not dismiss it entirely since it's open-source and user-friendly.

DeepSeek can be used for processing large volumes of transaction data, such as credit card statements, by extracting details like vendor names, amounts, and information about transactions. In your demo example:

1. **Currency Determination Issue**: If the currency isn't clearly determined (e.g., a long statement), DeepSeek might lose context faster or struggle to retain instructions.

2. **Structured Output Limitations**: While DeepSeek provides detailed reasoning during analysis, it doesn't always produce a structured output, which may make debugging more difficult compared to models like GPT-4.

3. **File Handling**: If the file isn't properly formatted (e.g., only PDF or CSV), DeepSeek might not clean up the content as effectively, leading to loss of context or information being lost.

For your demo, you could expand on these points by discussing how to structure outputs in future steps, handle sensitive data, and ensure files are properly formatted.
