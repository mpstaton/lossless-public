Okay, so the user provided a detailed prompt with some test results. They want to continue this experiment but I need to figure out what changes they're looking for or maybe suggest something else based on their feedback.

First, let me look at the data they've given. In the initial context window, when they used "remove unused code in agent task," it jumped to 16k tokens and 35 cents. When they applied a different prompt "clean up blog tasks," it went down to 22k tokens and 30 cents. Then applying "remove console log," it was 9k tokens and 9 cents.

Hmm, I notice that when they used the clean up blog task prompt, which was the second test case, the token count dropped by 18k (from 16k to 22k). That's a big change. Maybe they were cleaning more things there. But in their third test, using "remove console log," it went from 16k to 9k and only saved 7 lines of code.

Wait, so why did the token count go down for both clean up tasks? Is it because some of those blog tasks or console logs were actually redundant or had a lot of unused code that was being cleaned out?

The user also mentioned they found duplicate CSS at 100 lines. That's a significant number of lines to remove, so maybe the token count is reflecting that effort. They saved 7 lines with just 9k tokens, which seems efficient.

I wonder if this change would help them more in their daily tasks or in their professional life by saving more money and time? It could be really useful for developers who are working on a lot of projects because they can apply these prompts and get immediate token counts.

But I should also think about whether this is the best use of their time. Maybe there's something else they could explore, like improving another aspect or creating a new tool based on this knowledge. They might need more data to see if it scales up in other contexts.

I should probably ask them what specific areas they want to focus on next after seeing how this changes their tokens and costs. Maybe something related to blog tasks, console logs, bug fixes, or another area that stands out to them. Also, understanding the exact token count drops will help me tailor my advice better.

Overall, it seems like a solid experiment with good results. They're on the right track, but they might want more insights into how this change affects their workflow and if there's any additional feature they can create based on these findings.

It looks like you've already done an excellent job analyzing the token count changes in different test cases! The significant drops in tokens (e.g., from 16k to 9k) suggest that your prompts are effectively removing unused or redundant code, which is a great way to improve efficiency. Let me know what specific areas of code you're cleaning up and how this change affects your workflow, and I can help you craft more targeted feedback! ðŸ˜Š
