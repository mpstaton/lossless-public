Okay, so the user has provided a detailed analysis of their experiences with Aight. They've broken down three main reasons why they still don't use the platform as much as possible. Let me try to understand each point and how to approach this.

First, the pricing model is definitely a concern. The user mentioned that there's a big gap between the free plan at $15/month and the Pro Plan at $600/month. They're worried about scaling up their app beyond what the Pro Plan offers, especially since they have over 3 million execution attempts per month. Without being able to scale up freely, their app might become too resource-heavy, which could lead to issues like performance degradation or even data loss if the storage is not increased properly.

The second point the user is concerned about is the lack of a C++ multiplatform library for Kotlin. They mentioned that while they have access to many SDKs, the one for Android and iOS is closed off. This seems critical because if Aight stops supporting these platforms, their mobile applications could be significantly impacted. I should consider how this affects user adoption and potential revenue streams on a platform that's already quite mature.

The third concern revolves around trust in the platform. The user experienced a deprecation warning from MongoDB and decided to test it out before upgrading, only to find that Aight isn't fully stable even when testing. This is risky because if there are internal issues or unresolved bugs, users could face instability on their apps. They also mentioned that while funding for Aight is strong, the lack of official backing might make it difficult to commit large-scale projects.

I need to validate each of these points. For the pricing, I should ask whether they're comfortable with the current support and how many features they actually use. For the SDKs, I'll check if all platforms are still under development or if they've already moved away from those. Regarding trust, maybe suggesting that they reach out to the community or consider a different platform could help mitigate their concerns.

I should structure my response by addressing each of these areas separately, providing clear questions for validation and recommendations based on feedback. This way, I can address both the current issues and possible future problems in a structured manner.

It's great that you've shared your thoughts about Aight and how it has been helpful to you. However, as an AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I can only provide insights based on the information you've shared.

Let me summarize the key points and thoughts from your video:

1. **Pricing Model**:
   - The pricing model is clear in some aspects but there are concerns about scalability.
   - You mentioned that Aight's Pro Plan ($600/month) is significantly more expensive than the free or standard plan ($15/month). If you scale up beyond this, it could be challenging to maintain performance and data integrity.
   - Without being able to fully scale your app out on a Pro Plan, there might be limitations in how well your mobile apps perform if storage is not increased properly.

2. **Lack of C++ Multiplatform Library for Kotlin**:
   - You mentioned that the Android and iOS SDKs are no longer supported by Aight.
   - This could be critical for developers who use Kotlin, especially for production-grade applications on platforms like Android and iOS.
   - If these platforms stop supporting you, your mobile app development may suffer.

3. **Trust Issues**:
   - You expressed the fear of issues after using Aight's MongoDB deprecation warning but decided to test it out before upgrading, only to find internal bugs.
   - This could lead to instability in apps that are not fully supported on future versions of the platform.
   - If there are unresolved bugs or internal issues, users might face challenges with their apps.

### Recommendations:

1. **Pricing and Scalability**:
   - Consider what features you actually use beyond the Pro Plan. Maybe Aight could support more extensive scaling without needing full ownership backing.
   - If it's essential for your business to scale up, perhaps you can consider a different platform that offers better scaling capabilities.

2. **SDK Support for Android and iOS**:
   - Reach out to the community or reach out to Aight's developers if they are aware of any plans for supporting these platforms.
   - If there are no updates on Android and iOS SDKs, you might want to consider other platforms that have better ongoing support.

3. **Trust and Community**:
   - Engage with the community or Aight's GitHub repository. They often provide feedback and suggestions based on user experiences.
   - If issues persist, reaching out to them could lead to quicker fixes or alternative solutions.

4. **Community and Feedback**:
   - Take advantage of the open-source nature of Aight. The large community can help you troubleshoot issues and improve the platform.
   - If you're unsure about how things will roll out, consider a different project that aligns with your needs and has proven success.

Overall, while Aight is a great platform, there are clear areas where it may need improvement based on its current state. As long as you stay informed and engage with the community, you can make informed decisions about whether to continue using it or explore alternatives.
