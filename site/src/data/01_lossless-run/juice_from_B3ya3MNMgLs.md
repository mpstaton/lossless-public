Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to use these effects in my video editing. I remember there are all these push transitions, drop shadow, camera shake, etc., but I'm not exactly sure where to start. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I think about the transition effect. I've heard of using it for getting the logo on screen and then exiting quickly. I saw in my video that when I added a push transition, it worked smoothly at the beginning. But I'm not sure how to create one myself without just copying it from somewhere else. Maybe there's a shortcut or something?

Then I look into the drop shadow effect. I know it's used for camera shake and some floating motion. The settings are confusing, especially with all the options like speed scale and motion scale. How do I find which option to use? I think using the search bar is key here.

Blanking fill seems more complicated. It requires choosing from several options: filling with a photo from vertical or horizontal video, blurring the background, and adding a global blend. That sounds time-consuming if I'm not experienced. Maybe there's a simpler way to duplicate a frame for blur?

Photogrammy is another effect that just copies a frame into itself but in different sizes. That seems useful for adjusting proportions in shots. How do I make sure it doesn't mess up the composition? The settings are tricky, though.

I also see transitions as shortcuts for getting things on screen quickly and then exiting. It's so much easier than trying to set all those settings manually. But how do I know which effect is best for my situation? Maybe if my video has a lot of action, a push transition would be good. For more subtle effects, maybe not.

I'm also confused about the difference between motion blur and floating motion. How do they both work together in videos? And when to use each instead of the other?

Let me try to outline the steps I should take:

1. **Transition Effect:**
   - Use search bar for push transitions.
   - Right-click on a transition and choose Create Transition Preset.
   - Label it with my name so others know it's mine.

2. **Drop Shadow:**
   - Search for "drop shadow" in effects panel.
   - Look at the settings, maybe use the search again to find specific options.
   - Consider using the "Copy Photo" feature if I have a video that's shorter vertically.

3. **Blanking Fill:**
   - Again, search and see options like "copy photo from vertical or horizontal."
   - Maybe watch a tutorial on how it works for better understanding.

4. **Photogrammy:**
   - Use the shortcuts to duplicate frames.
   - Adjust proportions carefully to avoid messing up the shot.

5. **Effect Comparison:**
   - After trying some effects, compare them based on my needs and preferences.
   - Maybe use an editor like Canva or Photoshop to play around with settings.

I think I should also experiment more and see which effect fits better for different parts of my video. It's all about finding what works best for each shot, so maybe trial and error is part of the process.

Wait, but sometimes I don't have a perfect frame in front of me. How do I use these effects without knowing exactly where to adjust? Maybe if I can identify key frames or look at similar clips online, that could help me get started with setting some parameters.

Also, I'm not sure how to avoid overcomplicating the settings. It's important to keep it simple but effective for my video. Maybe there are resources or tutorials on YouTube that show how experienced people use these effects without getting overwhelmed by all the options.

Overall, I think starting with what I can identify and experimenting a bit is the best approach. The more I try, the more comfortable I'll get with using these tools effectively.

To effectively utilize video editing effects like transitions, push, drop shadow, camera shake, and blanking fill, follow this organized plan:

### 1. **Transition Effect**
   - **Method:** Use search bar to find specific transition effects. Right-click on a transition and select "Create Transition Preset" for simplicity.
   - **Label:** Name your preset appropriately, such as "Get On Screen & Exit."

### 2. **Drop Shadow**
   - **Use:** Search for "drop shadow" in the effects panel.
   - **Options:** Focus on motion scale (for speed) and speed scale (for float motion). Use a search feature to find precise options if needed.

### 3. **Blanking Fill**
   - **Use:** Search for "blanking fill" or "copy photo" features. This allows you to duplicate frames, which can be useful for adjusting proportions without overcomplicating the shot.
   - **Practice:** Watch tutorials to understand how it works and avoid messing up compositions.

### 4. **Photogrammy**
   - **Method:** Use shortcuts like ` photogram` or similar tools in your video editing software.
   - **Proportions:** Adjust proportions carefully by setting the width and height if necessary, then previewing to ensure the shot remains balanced.

### 5. **Effect Comparison**
   - **Experiment:** Try different effects based on your needs (action-heavy or subtle) to see which works best.
   - **Tools:** Use an editor like Canva or Photoshop for experimentation and fine-tuning of settings.

### 6. **Avoid Overcomplication**
   - Start with identified key frames or similar clips online to get started without knowing all parameters.
   - Keep effects simple yet effective by focusing on your specific shot needs.

By experimenting and understanding each effect's purpose, you'll become more efficient in using these tools. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek tutorials for guidance as needed.
