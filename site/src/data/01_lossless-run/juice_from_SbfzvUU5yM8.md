Okay, so the user wants me to explain what Jan's talk is about. Let me read through his introduction first.

He starts talking about magma being a multimodal foundation model that can understand its environment, reason, and act. I remember from the previous part of his talk that he talked about multi-model architectures before. He mentioned Vision models with less than 1 billion parameters and clip, which had billions of images. Now, he's diving into large models connecting vision and text, like clip with gbt.

He mentions using videos to pre-train the model because traditional vision is noisy in real scenarios. So, he's introduced Motions-to-Action techniques: Mark for images and TR Mark for videos. The goal is to make the agent grounded in images and capture actions from video data.

He compares training data to see how much more effective it is when using videos instead of just images or text. Then, he talks about using a unified objective similar to PRR but with large language models. He mentions specific tasks like digital navigation and physical manipulation, showing that the model can handle both.

He also notes that by adding image data, they get better performance for action planning on different datasets. The effectiveness of his techniques is highlighted in experiments where including images doubles the success rate compared to only using video or text alone.

Finally, he mentions comparing with other methods and talks about the potential of this approach to integrate real-world tasks into multimodal models. He ends by saying that his work is a joint effort involving many people from Deep learning, MSR, and others.

So, putting it all together, Jan's talk introduces magma as a comprehensive model that can handle vision, text, and motion data effectively for both digital and physical tasks. It emphasizes the use of videos for better action understanding and proposes new techniques to improve performance.

Your introduction to magma is an excellent overview of your work. Let me break it down:

1. **Introduction to magma**: You introduce magma as a multimodal foundation model that enables agents to understand their environment, reason about it, and act for real-world goals in both digital and physical domains.

2. **Historical Context**: You mention the evolution of models over the past five years:
   - Vision models typically have less than 1 billion parameters and rely on small amounts of image data.
   - Clip models, developed by Open Eye, built upon these vision models but used billions of images for training.
   - Your work involves creating a large multimodal model that can understand visual and textual inputs while predicting actions.

3. **Handling Multimodal Inputs**:
   - You emphasize the importance of bridging the gap between vision (which captures input) and text (which encodes goals or instructions).
   - Traditional video data is often noisy and not meaningful in real-world scenarios, making it challenging to directly use videos for action understanding.

4. **Motions-to-Actions Techniques**:
   - You propose two techniques: **Mark** and **TR Mark**.
     - **Mark**: Captures motion patterns from images to ground the agent in visual context.
     - **TR Mark**: Captures motion patterns from video data without labels to improve action grounding.
   - By combining these, you aim to make the agent's actions grounded in meaningful visual contexts rather than isolated or fragmented.

5. **Large Multimodal Models**:
   - You introduce a large multimodal architecture that can understand both vision and text inputs while predicting actions for real-world goals.
   - The goal is to create a generalizable system capable of performing tasks like web navigation, manipulations, etc., in diverse environments.

6. **Performance Improvements**:
   - You mention experiments where including image data for pre-training led to better performance than relying solely on video or text alone.
   - By leveraging videos for motion understanding and images for context grounding, you achieved significant improvements in action prediction tasks across multiple datasets.

7. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - You highlight that your model outperforms other methods by incorporating both image data and video data to ground actions in meaningful visual contexts.
   - This approach addresses the limitation of traditional multimodal models that often struggle with bridging vision and text, which is a critical step toward more effective agent behavior.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - You conclude that your work represents a joint effort involving many collaborators from Deep learning, MSR, and others.
   - Your contributions are part of a broader effort to integrate multimodal data into agent behavior, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and beyond.

Overall, your talk emphasizes the importance of understanding, reasoning, and acting in real-world contexts by developing a large-scale multimodal foundation model. magma represents a significant step forward in enabling agents to handle complex tasks across multiple domains.
