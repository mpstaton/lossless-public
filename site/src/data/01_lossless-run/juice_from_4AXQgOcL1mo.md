Alright, so the user is looking at this React tutorial and seems confused about immutable state and mutations. They mentioned they didn't understand why React tells us we need to use immutables by replacing old data with new data that includes changes. It also made them wonder how we avoid mutating data in certain ways.

The user's main points are: 
1. Why can't we mutate the current state? Because it doesn't change.
2. How do we prevent mutations? By using immutable data and updating it in another place instead of changing the state directly.
3. The importance of not mutating things, especially when state isn't changing.

They also want to know how to avoid this forever, like adding unique IDs or event handlers, but that's covered later.

So, I need to break down each part clearly. Maybe start with an example of muting a remote and then show how immutable data is different. Use a simple scenario where we add a user and update the UI without changing the state, which would be immutable.

For preventing mutations, explain replacing old data with new data that includes changes. Use another example to show the difference between mutating now (which doesn't change) and using immutable data. Maybe talk about how when you mutate a remote in React, it's mutable because it can change, but if you use an object inside state, changing it there won't affect the component unless you also update other parts.

Also, touch on why immutability is important for predictable behavior, avoiding unexpected state changes. This ties into future steps like using event handlers or query tools to fetch data without mutating in React.

Make sure each concept builds on the previous one with examples so it's easier to follow.
</think>

Of course! Let me break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Why React Tells Us We Can't Mutate Current State**
React uses `State` hooks to manage state, which is immutable by default. This means you can't change the values stored in your state after it's initialized. Instead, you have to:
- Create a new object that includes the changes.
- Update the original state (which won't change) with this new data.

For example:
```javascript
const user = { id: 1 };
// If we mutate React, we'd do something like:
// const { user } = { user: {} };
```

But if you try to mutate the current state, it doesn't work because `State` is immutable. You have to always update your data in another place.

---

### 2. **How to Prevent Mutations** [Optional]
To prevent mutations and ensure that changes are reflected without altering the original state, use an alternative approach:
- Use a different mechanism (like event handlers or query tools) to fetch the updated data.
- Replace the old data with new data that includes the changes.

For example:
```javascript
// In your component:
if (!useEffect({
  count: 0,
  user: {
    id: 123
  }
})) {
  yield useEffect({
    count: 0,
    user: { id: 123 }
  });
}
```

---

### 3. **Why We Should Prevent Mutations** [Long-Term]
- Avoid unexpected changes in your UI and state.
- Ensure consistent behavior across multiple runs of the app.
- When using immutable data, you can control exactly what happens to the system.

---

### 4. **How React's `State` Handles Changes**
If you try to mutate a remote (which is mutable), it doesn't change because React's state isn't immutable:
```javascript
const user = { id: 1 };
// If we mutate React, like this:
// const { user } = {
//   user: {}
// };

// The state remains the same, but if we try to mutate it, nothing changes!
```

---

### 5. **Why You Must Replace Data**
React's mutable state (like a remote) allows you to change the values stored in `state`. However:
- If you modify `state` right now, it doesn't affect your component.
- To fix this, you must update the original data with new values that include changes.

For example:
```javascript
// This is mutable and won't work for our purposes because React's state isn't immutable.
const user = { id: 1 };
// If we mutate React to change the user object, nothing happens!
const { user } = {
  id: 2,
  user: {
    id: 1
  }
};

// We must update the original data with new values:
const updatedUser = { id: 2, user: user };
// Now, when we mutate React and yield `updatedUser`, the state updates.
yield useEffect(updatedUser);
```

---

### 6. **Why Use immutable Data?**
- Avoid unexpected changes in your UI.
- Ensure predictable behavior across multiple runs.

---

### 7. **How to Update a Remote with Event Handlers**
If you want React to update without mutating its current state, you can use event handlers or query tools:
```javascript
// In your component:
if (!useEffect({
  count: 0,
  user: {
    id: 123
  }
})) {
  yield useEffect({
    count: 0,
    user: { id: 123 }
  });
}
```

---

### 8. **How to Use Query Tools**
You can also fetch updated data from the server using query tools:
```javascript
// In your component:
if (!useEffect({
  count: 0,
  user: {
    id: 123
  }
})) {
  const { count, user } = useQuery({
    count: 0,
    user: { id: 123 }
  });
  
  // When you mutate React and yield this new data, the state updates.
  yield useEffect({ count, user });
}
```

---

### 9. **How to Use Query Tools in Your Component**
You can also add event handlers inside your component:
```javascript
// In your component:
if (!useEffect({
  count: 0,
  user: {
    id: 123
  }
})) {
  const { count, user } = useQuery({
    count: 0,
    user: { id: 123 }
  });
  
  if (!useEffect(user)) {
    yield useEffect({ count, user });
  }
}
```

---

### 10. **When to Use immutable Data**
- When you want predictable behavior.
- When you need to control exactly what changes happen in your system.
- For testing purposes.

---

### Summary
React tells us we can't mutate current state because it's immutable by default. However, we can prevent mutations by:
1. Using event handlers or query tools that fetch updated data.
2. Maintaining an immutable data structure (like `useEffect` with a fixed object).
3. Updating the original data before mutating React.

By doing this, you ensure that changes are reflected in your UI without altering the system state that React manages.
