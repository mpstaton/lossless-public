Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this user's query. They're using Langlow to compare three different model providers—Grock, LLaMA, and DeepSeek—and they've set up a "Hello World" app in Python for each version. The user wants to execute these apps simultaneously across multiple sessions, each with its own session ID. 

Hmm, I remember that Langlow allows running multiple flows or processes at the same time by setting different session IDs. So maybe the first step is to explain how Langlow manages these parallel runs. Each flow will have its own session, and they should be independent of each other.

Wait, but the user mentioned flipping a button on some part of it. I think that might refer to something like enabling parallel execution in Langlow itself or adjusting how flows are run simultaneously. Maybe I need to mention any adjustments they might need before starting the comparison.

Now, for the "Hello World" apps. Each model has its own parameter count and setup. Grock uses 70 billion parameters, LLaMA has around 1.5 billion, and DeepSeek is huge at 671 billion. I should explain why these numbers matter—like how they affect model speed and resource usage.

The user wants to see the outputs in parallel. So Langlow needs to be set up to run each app separately without interfering with each other. They might need to adjust the settings, maybe enabling session isolation or exclusive access so that each app runs smoothly without conflicts.

I should also suggest some metrics they can monitor. Time taken for execution, memory usage, and whether there are any errors during the comparison. This will help them understand if their setup is working correctly and if any adjustments were necessary.

Putting it all together, I think the user wants to test how each model performs quickly when run in parallel. They might be exploring model efficiency or resource utilization. By setting up Langlow to handle multiple flows, they can get insights into how different models scale with more computational resources.

I should make sure my explanation is clear and covers setting up Langlow correctly, the parameter differences between models, running flows simultaneously, and monitoring performance metrics. That way, even someone new to Langlow can understand what's happening and troubleshoot if needed.

Got it! This feature allows you to run multiple model executions or processes in parallel within a single session, with each process having its own session ID. Here's how you can set this up:

1. **Create Parallel Flows**: For each of the three models (Grock, LLaMA, and DeepSeek), create a separate "Hello World" flow or app. Each flow will run independently because they have different parameters (e.g., Grock has 70 billion parameters, LLaMA has ~1.5 billion, and DeepSeek has ~671 billion) that affect execution speed.

2. **Set Up Parallel Execution**:
    - In Langlow, go to the settings for your flows.
    - Under "Execution mode," select "Parallel" or a similar option to enable simultaneous execution.
    - You might also need to adjust parameters like session isolation or exclusive access to allow each flow to run independently without interfering with others.

3. **Run in Parallel**:
    - For each model, set up your "Hello World" app so that it simulates training a model on a single sample (e.g., just printing `hello world`).
    - Run all three flows simultaneously using the same Langlow session ID but different individual IDs for each flow.

4. **Monitor Performance**:
    - After running, check the metrics provided by Langlow to see how long it takes for each model to complete and whether there are any resource limitations.
    - You can also compare memory usage, speed, or other relevant metrics across the three flows.

This setup will allow you to test how different models perform when executed in parallel. Adjust the parameters as needed based on your specific requirements for execution time, resource usage, or simplicity of the task.
