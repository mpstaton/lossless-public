Okay, so I'm looking at this code example provided. It seems like someone wants to set up a dynamic component using React and possibly some additional libraries or features. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, they import React and useState from React. That makes sense for creating stateful components. The component is named 'codeBlock' and takes a prop called 'language', which is either 'js' or 'typescript'. So the user wants this component to switch between JavaScript and TypeScript based on the language parameter.

Looking at the return statement, it's pretty straightforward. It returns a div with some static content and an embedding of the code block from the code input. Then, there's a function inside that updates the state using useEffect hook. This seems like they're listening for changes in the component's state, probably to re-render when either language or TypeScript is updated.

I notice they use the 'src' prop with 'js' and 'typescript' respectively. That's correct because React allows you to specify both JavaScript and TypeScript interfaces. Then, on the component mount, it checks if 'language' is 'js', else uses 'typescript'.

The key part is the lit component that wraps the code input. Lit components are lightweight and perfect for things like this where they only need a few lines of state without affecting performance too much. The reason I mention 'lit' is because it's one layer, which keeps everything clean.

On copy time, there's a custom CSS class used to set a white shadow on the div when clicked. That looks good but maybe could be improved with some styling classes if needed later.

So, putting this all together, the code sets up a component that allows switching between JavaScript and TypeScript interfaces easily using React, and it does so efficiently by embedding a lit component in the right place.

This code is an example of setting up a component to switch between JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript interfaces. Here's what each part does:

1. **Imports**:
   - `import React from 'react';` - Used for React components
   - `import { useState } from 'react';` - For managing state in the component

2. **Component Definition**:
```typescript
function codeBlock(language: 'js' | 'typescript') {
  return (
    <div>
      <span>{language === 'js' ? 'JavaScript' : 'TypeScript (TS)'}</span>
      {language === 'js' ? `<pre>${src}/src/JS.ts` : `<pre>${src}/src/TS.ts``}
      <code input={src/sym/sym-tsc-dotb.dotc.html} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. **State Management**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (language !== 'js') language = 'typescript';
}, src/sym/tsc/tsc.js);
```

### Explanation:
- This component allows the user to easily switch between JavaScript and TypeScript interfaces by simply changing the `language` prop.
- The lit component (`<code>`) embeds the code input from `src/sym/sym-tsc.dotc.html`, making it lightweight.
- The lit component automatically updates when either JS/TS changes or language is updated.

This setup provides a clean, lightweight solution for creating components that work with JavaScript and TypeScript interfaces.
