Alright, so the user provided a detailed query about setting up an email template for Gmail. They mentioned using tools like Gmail API, Reddit scraper, and OpenWeatherMap credentials. My job is to create a step-by-step guide based on their instructions.

First, I need to understand each tool's setup. The Gmail API allows users to sign in with their Google account and access emails via their phone number. The Reddit scraper tool requires an API key from Rapid AI. For the OpenWeatherMap credentials, a weather API key is necessary to fetch weather data.

I should outline each step clearly, starting with setting up the Gmail account. Then move on to installing the Reddit scraper and using it for scraping posts. After that, I'll discuss how to set up Google Cloud services like OpenWeatherMap for fetching weather data.

The user also provided a template for the email, so I need to ensure the guide includes all necessary steps from creating the email header to providing contact information. Including instructions on installing tools and using API keys is crucial for the guide's success.

I should make sure each step is numbered and easy to follow, avoiding any technical jargon that might confuse someone new. The guide should be comprehensive but straightforward, ensuring that users can follow along without getting overwhelmed.
