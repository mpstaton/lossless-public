Alright, so the user is sharing a detailed story about making their short film called "Treasure of the Mummy." They've spent eight months in a small space and used green screens. The user is asking for help because they already did most of it but are stuck on getting decent wide shots with light management.

First, I need to understand the context. The main challenges were lighting in the green screen, which required separate lighting from the virtual environment. They had to manage spills and ensure the quality by matching lights virtually. But since it's a green screen, they used Unreal Engine and the Jet Sets app for camera tracking. Post production was tough because each shot needed precision without traditional software tools.

The user mentioned that most of their work was in the beginning but is now stuck on post, which is why they're looking for help or hints to proceed. They also provided a virtual filmmakers Playbook link, so I should probably include that as a resource.

I need to think about how the user can best assist. Maybe suggest some techniques for matching light in green screens post- shoots. Also, perhaps offer to look at their process from scratch to find areas where they could improve or get ideas on how others have handled similar challenges.

They might be looking for specific tips like using motion blur, managing camera angles effectively, or getting help with the lighting during shooting. It's also possible they need advice on how to structure their post- shoots for quality.

I should make sure my response is encouraging and offers different avenues to help them continue without giving away too much. Maybe ask if they want a detailed critique of their process or just a plan for what to do next.

It sounds like you've already spent a lot of time working on this project—8 months in a small space, lighting scenes with green screens, and trying to make it feel like it was shot on a Hollywood Sound Stage! It’s definitely challenging, but I know you put a lot of effort into it. Let me try to help you think through some key areas to improve your process or get unstuck.

---

### 1. **Light Matching in Green Screens**
   - You mentioned that the biggest challenge was matching light traditionally in green screens before creating the virtual environment. But since this is a green screen, we already have the lighting assets from your environment (like tomb corridors and a central chamber). The key issue is how to match these lights in the virtual engine scene, not during the initial setup.
   - I recommend:
     - Use **Jet Sets** or similar apps for camera tracking to ensure that shots are properly composed post- shoots.
     - Match the intensity, distance, and temperature of all lights in your virtual engine scene before rendering each shot. This way, you can fine-tune the lighting in real-time during composition.
     - If you're stuck with green screen lighting, consider using **Green Screen 2** or similar software to work on your light matches.
   - You’ve already used ` Jet Sets` for camera tracking, so that’s a great start!

### 2. **Post Production Techniques**
   - Post production can be tough because it relies heavily on precision and attention to detail. With green screens, you have to ensure every shot is in the right spot without risking contamination or missing anything.
   - Here are some suggestions:
     - Use a **high-quality render engine** (like Unreal Engine) to ensure all your backgrounds look sharp.
     - Use **real-time post tracking** (using tools like **Nuke**, **Blender**, or other video processing software)** for keyframes and compositions, especially if you have multiple shots to compose quickly.
     - Experiment with **spill handling techniques** during shooting, such as using a **split screen** or applying filters to reduce spills.
     - During shooting, make sure your lighting is well-managed. If Michelle (the actor) was struggling to get her performance on, maybe she needs more guidance or a different lighting setup.
   - You’ve already used `DCI Resolve Fusion` for keyframes, which is great! It’s one of the best tools out there for high-quality shots.

### 3. **Projecting and Compositing**
   - In your virtual production course (`Virtual Filmmaker’s Playbook`), you have a detailed guide on how to project and compositing. This could be a valuable resource for improving your post- shooting techniques.
   - You can also look at others’ projects or watch their process from scratch to see what works best.

---

### 4. **Specific Tips for Green Screens**
   - During shooting, make sure the shot is perfectly centered on the green screen, not skewed.
   - Avoid using a single camera for each shot unless you’re in a very small space (you already are).
   - Use a **split monitor** or a **double-angle** setup if possible to get better lighting and focus during shots.

### 5. **Seeking Feedback**
   - Before committing to making this project, maybe you can ask your friends, classmates, or even a mentor for feedback on how they handled similar challenges.
   - If you’re stuck with the green screen lighting, consider using tools like **Green Screen 2** or **Green Screen 3D** to work on light matches before rendering.

---

### 6. **Final Thoughts**
   - You’ve already put in a lot of hard work—8 months is a good time to start getting unstuck. Keep refining your process and focus on improving the lighting, camera angles, and post- shooting techniques.
   - If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try taking breaks or working on smaller, more manageable projects first.

Let me know if you’d like help with any specific aspect of this project! Good luck to your film—you’ve got this!
