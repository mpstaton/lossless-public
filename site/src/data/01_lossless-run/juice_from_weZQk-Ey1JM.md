Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a detailed breakdown of the C-Storm video they just watched, which was about explaining how it works and its capabilities in AI research tools. They also included their own thoughts on installing the local version using Git and cloning repositories.

Now, looking at their current query: "How can I install the local version with Git?" It seems like they're trying to set up C-Storm locally for use without internet access or installation issues.

I remember from the previous response that the setup involves cloning a GitHub repository, installing dependencies, and then adding a virtual environment. I should structure this step by step, making sure each part is clear and concise.

Also, I need to ensure that the instructions are straightforward so the user can follow without confusion. Including the commands with explanations will help them understand what's happening at each stage.

I think breaking it down into separate steps would make it easier for them to grasp each part of the installation process. Maybe using bullet points or numbered lists could help, but since they prefer text-based instructions, I'll stick to that.

Finally, I should remind them about installing additional dependencies and handling any potential issues, just in case they encounter problems down the line.

Great question! Installing C-Storm locally will allow you to access it through a web interface without needing an internet connection. Here's how you can set up the local version using Git and GitHub:

---

### **Step-by-Step Installation Instructions for Local C-Storm**

#### **1. Clone the GitHub Repository**
First, download and clone the C-Storm repository from GitHub to your local development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[Yourusername]/C-Storm-Local.git
```

Replace `[Yourusername]` with your GitHub username or organization name. You can use either `username` or `org` depending on how the repository is set up in your organization.

---

#### **2. Install Dependencies**
The local version of C-Storm relies on several dependencies. Run the following command to install them:

```bash
cd C-Storm-Local && npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages and tools for running C-Storm locally.

---

#### **3. Create a Virtual Environment**
Since you want to run commands in your local development environment, create a virtual `Git` environment with these commands:

```bash
git init .
git add .gitconfig.gpg
git add .gitconfig
git add .gitconfig set-up-notif
```

This will ensure that Git is aware of all the changes and updates to your project.

---

#### **4. Install Local C-Storm**
Now, install the local version of C-Storm using Git. Run these commands:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/src
git checkout local-cstorm
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project/src` with the directory containing the `src` folder in your cloned repository.

---

#### **5. Access the Local C-Storm**
After installing, you can access C-Storm locally through a web interface. Run these commands to start the server:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/src && npm start
```

This will open the local C-Storm server in your default browser window.

---

### **Summary of Steps**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies and create a virtual `Git` environment.
3. Add all necessary files to the virtual environment.
4. Create a new `src` directory within your project structure.
5. Check out the local C-Storm version from the repository.
6. Start the server locally.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- If you need additional dependencies for running C-Storm locally, install them using:
  ```bash
  npm install --no-cache -D https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/c-storm/c-storm .
  ```
- If you encounter any issues during installation or access, let me know!
