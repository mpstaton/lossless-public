Okay, so I just saw this video about different coding assistants, and it's pretty interesting. Let me try to break down what I understand from it.

First off, there are several people talking about different tools they use inside Visual Studio Code or within terminals. The main point seems to be comparing how helpful each is in various areas like token consumption and performance. 

I noticed that the client assistant on Contin is really good at saving tokens because it can cash out using models, which makes sense since you don't want to spend too many tokens if possible. That's a nice feature.

Then there's Super M moving. I think it uses local git for version control, but wait, does that mean it stores files in a git repository? If so, wouldn't that be useful for tracking changes and collaborating on code? Maybe that's why the user said they have trouble with version control tools because it complicates things.

Super M also has these features like adding custom prompts to the chat. That sounds handy if you want to communicate more effectively within the codebase without having to write your own messages or anything. It makes sense as a premium feature, which is a good point since they're offering a free trial with Contin.

Contin is great for complex tasks and has automatic updates every two weeks. I guess that's important because it saves time on updating packages and fixing issues, which can be tedious to do manually. Plus, the terminal version of Contin is super useful if you don't want to use Visual Studio Code because it's more flexible with file paths.

Super M seems a bit outdated compared to others in this area. The user mentioned that it might not handle everything well, especially for newer features or custom setups. Itâ€™s probably why they switched to Contin instead of Super M after some time.

The client assistant on Cline is the worst at saving tokens because it can't automatically cash out from models, which means you'd have to use your real tokens manually. That's a big downside compared to the others.

I also remember that this video is part of a channel called "LITERALLY" and they've been sharing a lot about these tools. They're trying to cover all bases, but I'm not sure how balanced it is in each category. It seems like a good overview, but maybe there's more to talk about in future videos.

Overall, the user was on board with this content, which helps keep me engaged and learning. I think they probably want to find the best tools for their workflow, so taking notes about all these features would be helpful.

This video is a comprehensive comparison of different coding assistants within Visual Studio Code and terminals, highlighting their strengths in token consumption and performance across various tasks. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Client Assistant on Contin**: 
   - **Strengths**: 
     - Super M moving offers local git version control, which can be useful for tracking changes.
     - Adds custom prompts to the chat, enhancing communication within the codebase.
     - Automates updates every two weeks and has automatic file system management.
     - Terminal version is versatile for quick execution without Visual Studio Code.

2. **Client Assistant on Super M Moving**: 
   - **Strengths**:
     - Uses local git repository for version control, though its features are considered outdated.
     - Effective at saving tokens via models due to the free trial offer.

3. **Client Assistant on Cline**: 
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - Automatically cashing out from models is a significant drawback as it requires manual token use.

4. **Conclusion**: The video provides an overview of tools in this area, suggesting Contin is top-tier for complex tasks and super moving for effective chat communication. It's well-covered but could delve deeper into future topics.
