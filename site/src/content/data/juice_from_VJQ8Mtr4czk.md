Alright, I need to help the user understand what's happening with Affinity Photo. They mentioned that they just wanted a video explaining why this update is significant. Let me break down their query step by step.

First, the user has provided a detailed thought process of an AI assistant discussing the update. Now, they want a response to their own question: "Hey there! It's nice to see you earlier in the week. Affinity just dropped a huge update that makes a lot of waves in the industry and this deserved making a video sooner. The next Friday so I just wanted to talk about it kind of give you guys some insight on what it is and why it's so important and why I think it's so significant if you don't know what Affinity is."

So, they're asking for a summary or explanation of the update, specifically focusing on Affinity Photo, Generative Fill, Designer, and Publisher. They want an overview of what these tools are, how they differ from Adobe, and why this change is important.

I should make sure to mention the key features introduced in Affinity Photo 2.6, like machine learning for object and subject selection, which uses local computations on your computer without needing internet access. Also, highlight that this is a big shift because it's not just about AI but about local computation, making it more secure and private.

I should also touch upon how this affects users: they pay once, forever, which is a significant cost-saving feature. Mention how the new features are different from Adobe tools, especially since Affinity doesn't rely on data from users, thus avoiding legal issues related to NDA breaches.

Additionally, I need to explain why someone would be impressed by these changes—like, it's a big step forward in AI adoption beyond Adobe. It shows that Affinity is taking a lead and being more market-leading.

I should structure this into clear points, maybe using bullet points for readability. Make sure the language is clear and concise since the user might not have a technical background. Also, emphasize why this update is important to potential customers or businesses looking to adopt Affinity Photo.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by encouraging them to check out Affinity Photo if they haven't already, based on their analysis.

Great question! **Affinity Photo 2.6** introduces several significant updates that set it apart from competitors like Adobe. Here's an overview of what you can expect:

1. **Machine Learning in Object and Subject Selection**: Unlike Adobe tools, which require users to manually select or edit objects (like images), Affinity Photo uses machine learning to identify and mask objects. This means it automatically detects objects based on their context—like shapes, colors, and text—and applies masks automatically. It’s faster, more accurate, and less manual.

2. **Local Computations**: The most exciting feature is that this selection happens using local computations on your computer, without needing internet access. This means you can work with images, videos, or other files locally, reducing costs and eliminating the risk of data breaches from users.

3. **Security and Privacy**: Affinity Photo’s approach to AI is inherently more secure because it doesn’t rely on user-supplied data. It uses machine learning patterns to detect and mask objects, ensuring you don’t have to worry about legal issues related to data breaches or NDA violations.

4. **Cost-Effective**: By not requiring users to own the software, Affinity Photo can be sold for a lower price than Adobe. This is why it’s considered a big step forward in AI adoption beyond Adobe.

Overall, **Affinity Photo 2.6** is a game-changer because it leverages machine learning and local computations to provide better results with less cost and risk. It’s a market leader in AI adoption for photo editing software. If you’re looking to adopt this feature or check out the software, feel free to explore Affinity Photo further!
