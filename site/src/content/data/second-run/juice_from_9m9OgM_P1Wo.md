Okay, so I need to figure out how to build an open-source version of cursor. The user provided some background material, including a video showing the process, but now they want to start with the next step. They mentioned that it'll be two videos a week—Monday and Thursday—so maybe they're aiming for daily updates.

First, I should think about what's needed before diving into code. From the previous discussion, there are some tools available like mCP (multi-user call pool) which allows multiple users to make simultaneous calls from an agent. That's probably crucial because without having separate agents, each user would be acting on their own, which isn't efficient.

I remember that in multicasting, the llm has a way of handling incoming requests by using a network. So maybe I need to look into how that works. There are probably some code examples or documentation on how to use mCP with the agent. But without knowing the exact codebase, it's tricky, so perhaps starting with understanding the API and how it can be used.

Next, they mentioned setting up a call pool for the llm itself. I think this involves creating an instance of the llm in a way that allows multiple users to call simultaneously. Maybe using some kind of thread or concurrent calling mechanism? I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

Then there's the mCP tool itself. They mentioned that each mCP tool has its own API, and after being added to the agent, they need to communicate with the llm via the appropriate URL. This might involve sending commands through a POST request or something similar. But I'm not clear on how the llm processes these requests, if at all.

There's also some discussion about network topology and routing. They mentioned setting up a custom network where each mCP tool is connected to its own IP address so it can subscribe separately from the agent's IP. That makes sense because otherwise, all tools would be on the same port, which isn't practical for multiple users.

They referenced a specific command in the code example: "llm@localhost:3000". I think that's using the llm client on localhost port 3000 to handle incoming calls. But how does this translate into actual code? Do I need to modify the llm client to accept new mCP tools, or is there another approach?

I'm also thinking about how to structure the script. They provided some example scripts using Flask and OpenAI's API. Maybe they want to create a similar setup for an open-source llm. So perhaps the next step is to set up a custom llm that can handle these multicasting calls.

Wait, I should consider the communication protocol between mCP tools and the llm. Each tool has its own API endpoint. For example, maybe each tool's API is on http://<tool_ipaddress>/callcommand. So when the tool makes a call command, it sends a POST request to that endpoint with some JSON response from the llm.

But how does the agent handle this? Does it receive the call command and then send it to each tool? I'm not sure if the agent can process multiple requests at once or only one. Maybe there's an event-based model where when any tool receives a request, it sends it immediately to all available tools via their respective APIs.

I should also think about how data flows from the llm to the tools. Each tool needs to have access to the same knowledge base as the agent. So maybe each tool can have its own copy of the knowledge graph or database. But that might complicate things, especially if they're using a specific framework.

Perhaps it's better to have all tools share the same data model. That way, communication between them is easier and doesn't require managing copies. But I'm not sure how feasible that is in terms of performance for multiple tools and an agent.

Another point is error handling. If a tool makes a request, what happens if something goes wrong? Should it log errors, or should the llm handle them internally? The example script seems to just send the request and return a JSON response, so maybe I don't need to worry about that for now unless there are specific issues.

I also wonder about the scalability. If multiple tools are added, how does the performance of the agent change? Is it okay to have each tool handle their own requests without significantly impacting the system's speed or resource usage?

Additionally, communication protocols could be a hurdle. Using POST requests might not be suitable if the llm requires different methods of communication, like HTTP requests with headers or using other mechanisms. I need to ensure that the API responses match what the agent expects.

In summary, the next steps probably involve setting up the mCP tool instances, configuring how they interact with the llm, and ensuring a consistent communication protocol. Maybe starting by adding one tool, testing it out, and then expanding to multiple tools as needed.

To build an open-source cursor, we'll follow a structured approach based on the provided background material. The goal is to create a system where multiple users can make simultaneous calls from an agent without coordination issues.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Set Up mCP Tools:**
   - Create instances of each mCP tool in the llm client. This allows separate handling of incoming requests, ensuring that all tools operate independently on their own ports.

2. **Configure Communication Protocol:**
   - Implement a custom network topology where each tool is connected to its specific IP address. The llm client will use a protocol like `llm@localhost:3000` for communication.
   - Each mCP tool must have an API endpoint, such as `http://<tool_ipaddress>/callcommand`, which receives POST requests from the agent.

3. **Handle Call Commands:**
   - Modify the llm client to accept new call commands sent by each tool. This command is then processed and returned in JSON format, containing data necessary for the agent's knowledge base sharing.

4. **Data Flow and Synchronization:**
   - Ensure that all tools share a consistent data model for communication. The llm should handle internal data processing without needing copies from other tools.
   - Implement event-based communication where each tool processes requests immediately after receiving them, ensuring minimal overhead.

5. **Error Handling and Communication:**
   - Configure error handling to manage issues such as failed calls or unexpected responses. Use appropriate HTTP headers for protocol compliance.
   - Consider using different communication methods if POST requests don't match expected protocols.

6. **Scalability Testing:**
   - Test the system with one tool first, then expand to multiple tools. Monitor performance metrics and adjust configurations as needed.

By following these steps, we can create a robust multi-user call pool that enhances the functionality of the agent without coordination issues.
