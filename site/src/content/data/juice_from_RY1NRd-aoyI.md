Okay, let me try to figure out what Kevin Cookie Company needs help with. The user already provided a pretty detailed response about using co-pilot for email crafting, so maybe they need more prompts or additional tips. 

First, looking at their emails and feedback, they mentioned customer complaints about orders and the quality of products. So I should add a prompt where they can list all the action items from emails. Maybe something like "List all action items from today's emails" to ensure no details are missed.

Also, checking with Patty and Diego on other tasks seems important. Perhaps adding a prompt for them, but it might be better to ask if they need help drafting that instead of listing every email. 

In Outlook, they mentioned keeping an eye on the dough and ensuring all tasks are completed. Maybe they can add a prompt for this or suggest co-pilot features related to tracking tasks in Outlook, like task reminders or countdowns.

Another thought: the user didn't mention anything about support tickets. Adding a prompt where they can list and sort out their support requests might help them manage their to-do lists effectively. 

I should also consider other areas like meeting deadlines or setting priorities for different tasks. Maybe providing prompts there could cover more bases. 

Overall, I think adding specific examples from their workflow would be useful, but since the user is asking for more prompts and training, that's probably the best approach. They might benefit from creating a task list using co-pilot in Outlook and having it automatically sort them, which would save time on managing multiple tasks.
