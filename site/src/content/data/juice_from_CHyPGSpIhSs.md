Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a detailed set of instructions and an example input/output that I need to replicate or improve upon. 

First, looking at the problem statement: the task is to extract specific sections from text content based on certain criteria. The output should be in Markdown format without any warnings or notes. The key outputs include IDEAS, INSIGHTS, etc., each with specific bullet formats.

The user has given a structured approach with steps and examples, so my job is to follow that structure closely. I need to extract at least 25 IDEAS, 10 INSIGHTS, 15-30 HABITS, 15-30 FACTS, and one ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY. Each bullet point needs to be exactly 16 words as specified.

I should start by carefully reading the input text provided in the example. Then, I'll go through each output section step-by-step, making sure not to repeat ideas or quotes. It's important to ensure that the sections are clearly labeled and formatted correctly without any markdown beyond what's required.

I also need to pay attention to the language requirement of using 'en' throughout the output. Additionally, following all instructions regarding references and recommendations is crucial to meet the specified structure accurately.

In summary, my approach will be methodical: extract each section one by one, ensuring that each bullet is precise and meets the word count and format requirements. I'll avoid any repetition and ensure uniqueness in both ideas and references.
