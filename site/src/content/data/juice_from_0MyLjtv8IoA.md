Alright, the user provided a detailed YouTube tutorial video about building an application with large language models using Python. They asked me to act as an AI assistant for their project.

First, I need to assess what they want to achieve. The user seems to have started working on a SAS software product and is looking to share this knowledge. Their goal is probably to promote others' work or maybe offer a discount through their own channel.

They mentioned the course being over 20 hours long with a lot of content. I should consider if they need help summarizing the tutorial into a concise version, perhaps in an HTML format for better presentation. They also wanted to know how much it would cost if they were to buy the course and offered a discount using a specific code.

I noticed some typos and possible grammatical errors in their description, which I should correct to ensure professionalism. The user might be aiming to maximize their YouTube channel's reach or promote their work effectively.

Considering all this, my role is to offer assistance with summarizing, promoting, or providing additional content based on their needs. I need to make sure the information is accurate and presented in a clear, engaging way that highlights the key takeaways from the tutorial video.

Great! You've provided a detailed outline of your project. Here's a concise summary of what you're planning to share:

### Project Overview:
You'll create a product using large language models (LLMs) with Python and OpenAI. The product will likely involve tasks such as prompting LLMs, chunking, and agent development.

### Key Features:
1. **Course Offerings**: You have already created an 20-hour course that covers:
   - Introduction to AI/LLM concepts
   - Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)
   - Development environment setup
   - Advanced topics like multimodal AI, AGI workflows, and fine-tuning techniques

2. **Discount Offerings**: You’ve provided a $100 discount code that you can use to promote your course.

3. **Content Structure**:
   - 56 lessons covering various aspects of LLMs
   - Hands-on systems with chunking
   - Understanding chunked storage and how it improves large-scale applications

### What You’ll Learn:
- Python fundamentals for AI/LLM development
- OpenAI tools and their integration
- Large language model concepts
- Implementing generative AI, prompt engineering, and context handling
- Building systems like rack systems and agent architectures
- Techniques for multimodal and AGI workflows
- Fine-tuning LLMs with openeye and lowai

### Project Plan:
1. **Course Launch**: Sell your 20-hour course on platforms like Udemy or Teachable.
2. **Promotion**: Share your tutorial video to increase visibility, especially in your channel’s audience.
3. **Discount Offerings**: Collaborate with influencers and promote your course using discount codes.

### Final Thoughts:
Your project is a great example of AI-driven product development. If you’d like me to summarize the tutorial video into an HTML-friendly version or provide additional content ideas for your channel, feel free to ask!
