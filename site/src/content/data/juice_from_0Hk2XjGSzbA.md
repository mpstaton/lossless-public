Okay, I'm trying to understand how this repo works. So first, there's Fu and trunk. I guess Fu is on trunk but then they rebased Fu onto trunk. Wait, what does that mean? Is it like moving Fu up in the history? So instead of Fu being a separate branch after trunk, it's now part of the same timeline as trunk?

Then, when I checked out Fu using g.log and log, I saw some messages. Some were just numbers. That must be commit message times. Those are the timestamps where each commit was made. Then there were parents, which probably show the commits that generated those messages.

I'm confused about what the parents part shows. So if a commit has two parents, does that mean it's a branch that depends on another? Like, when you have Fu rebase trunk, maybe Fu points back to something else?

The graph seems pretty detailed now. It lists all the commits and their history, showing both forward and backward dependencies. That makes sense because it's not just about the current state but how each commit connects with others.

I also noticed that they mentioned rebase being better than merge. Why is that? Maybe merge commits cause inconsistency or something, whereas rebase allows you to have consistent changes without breaking the history.

But what if someone uses rebase and then merges without rebasing correctly? Would everything break? I think it's really important to keep track of where each commit depends on because otherwise, merging could mess up the timeline.

Overall, this repo setup seems like a good way to manage multiple commits in a single branch while keeping history intact. It helps with collaboration by showing how changes are connected. But I'm still a bit fuzzy on how exactly merge and rebase work compared to just using commit messages. Maybe if I look at each commit's history separately, it'll make more sense.

Also, the parents in the graph are useful because they show who created what, right? So if someone wants to change Fu, knowing that it depends on trunk is important. But maybe I should check how Fu and trunk were initially set up before rebasing.

In summary, this setup allows for easy tracking of changes through a timeline, helps with merging commits smoothly by keeping the history consistent, and provides detailed dependencies between branches. Rebase seems like an essential tool in managing such projects.

This repo setup is designed to manage multiple commits within a single branch while maintaining a clear timeline of history. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Rebase Functionality**: 
   - When you rebase Fu onto trunk, Fu becomes part of the trunk branch's history. Instead of being a separate branch, Fu now points back to the latest commit on trunk.
   - This means Fu no longer diverges from trunk and instead continues walking forward in time.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph displays both the current state (commit message times) and all parent commits for each commit.
   - Each commit has a list of parents, indicating who created it and how it connects to other commits or branches.

3. **Benefits of Rebase**:
   - It allows for consistent changes without breaking history.
   - Ensures that merging commits maintains the timeline integrity.
   - Provides clear dependencies between branches, useful for collaboration and change management.

4. **Comparison with Merge**:
   - Merge is used to combine two separate branches into a single commit, but it doesn't maintain the timeline unless explicitly rebased.
   - Rebase removes this inconsistency by moving commits forward in time relative to the target branch.

5. **Learning Outcomes**:
   - Understanding how merge and rebase work helps in managing multi-commit scenarios effectively.
   - The graph visualization aids in tracking dependencies between branches, crucial for understanding commit relationships.

In summary, this setup uses a timeline of commits through a graph representation, allowing easy management of multiple commits while maintaining consistency and history. Rebase is essential for ensuring that changes are applied correctly across the entire project.
