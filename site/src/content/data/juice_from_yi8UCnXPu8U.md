Alright, let's break down how I approached creating the portability pattern for the code. 

First, I wanted to understand what portability meant in this context. It seemed to refer to making sure my code could run smoothly across different environments and applications without issues. So, I decided to focus on keeping all my core functionality within a single file so that any changes would require just updating one place.

Next, I realized that the key parts of my application were inside a React Router Dom component, which was probably running on a Next.js server or another platform that supports React. This meant that any environment-specific code I added had to reference this component correctly.

I then thought about how other parts of my code could be used without relying solely on external services. The Pokemon API seems crucial for fetching data, so I figured out that it should remain local to the application. That way, even if Next.js was running elsewhere, the Pokemon API would always have access to the correct data.

Another important aspect was the environment provider. By creating a lib directory and using the react-rider-dom environment provider, I ensured that my code could run on different ports or servers without needing changes across environments. This involved setting up an export so that Next.js can import it properly.

Throughout this process, I made sure to test each component for functionality and responsiveness. I also considered how other users might interact with the application, ensuring that all parts loaded correctly and were easy to navigate from one environment to another.

Finally, by keeping everything in a single file, I aimed to simplify collaboration and make it easier for anyone working on this project to understand where their changes would affect without dealing with multiple files.

I'm looking forward to the next video! Let me create a portability pattern for my React Router Dom application. Here's what we're going to do:

1. **Create an Environment Provider File**:
   - In `lib/environment_provider.js`, we'll keep all our environment dependencies and setup.

2. **Reference Our Environment Provider in Next.js**:
   - Create a file that references the above provider, ensuring it can run on different ports or servers.

3. **Keep Core Logic Within One File**:
   - All core functionality for Pokemon fetching should be inside this provider so changes are only required to update dependencies.

4. **Remove Dependencies from External Services**:
   - Ensure all API calls and data fetchers are within our core logic, not relying on Next.js or React Router Dom itself.

5. **Test Across Environments**:
   - Make sure the Pokemon fetching works across different Next.js servers and environments without additional setup.

This approach will make my code more modular and easier to maintain. Let me start by creating a `lib/environment_provider` file that keeps all environment-related dependencies, then ensure it references correctly in Next.js.
