Okay, so the user wants to set up Local LLM inside Obidian similar to CH GPT. They provided a detailed video explanation on how to do that. Let me break down what they did.

First, they mentioned using Alama AMA as an open-source tool for running LLMs locally. They walked them through installing it by cloning the terminal command and pasting it into Obidian's terminal. I need to make sure I explain each step clearly so they know how to install and test the model.

Next, they recommended using the smart chat plugin because of the parameters. I should highlight that as a recommendation since it's popular and efficient. They also suggested any plugin from the available options, which gives them flexibility.

The installation process was described with commands for choosing models and installing embedded models. I need to detail each command step-by-step to ensure they understand how their Obidian setup will work.

They mentioned using a dsck model and embedding it as an LLM. It's important to note the specific steps for that configuration, like selecting the right plugin and starting the second brain button after testing.

Finally, the user asked if they've tried this yet and provided some feedback. I should thank them for sharing their experience so others can see the value of this setup. I'll make sure my response is friendly and encouraging to keep them motivated.

I think that's all the steps from the video explanation. Now, I'll structure my answer to cover each part clearly, maybe using bullet points for readability.

Great question! Yes, I can help you set up Local LLM inside Obidian similar to CH GPT. Let me break it down step-by-step:

---

### Step 1: Install Alama AMA (Open-Source LLM)
**Steps:**
1. Clone the terminal command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/llama-alab /path/to/your/terminal-window
   ```
2. Paste this command into your terminal window and load it:
   ```
   echo "llama-alab@latest" > /dev/null
   ```
3. Choose an **8B or 16B parameter model** from the list provided by Alama AMA for faster response times.
4. Select a **chat model (like smart chat)** to get better performance.

---

### Step 2: Enable Community Plugin in Obidian
1. Open Obidian and go to:
   - Settings > Community Plug-in
2. Click on **Browse Models**.
3. Search for your preferred LLM (e.g., dsck) by searching the name in the chat window.
4. Click **Install** after selecting your model.

---

### Step 3: Restart Obidian if Necessary
1. If you haven't already, restart Obidian to ensure the LLM is properly integrated with its chat window.

---

### Step 4: Use Local LLM Inside Obidian
Now that you've set up Alama AMA and installed the Community Plug-in in Obidian:
- You can now use your local LLM (e.g., dsck) inside Obidian's chat window.
- Simply type your LLM commands directly into your chat window for processing.

---

### Example of Using Local LLM in Obidian
1. Open your chat window and start typing a command like:
   ```
   dsck
   ```
2. Obidian will process the command using your local LLM model (e.g., dsck).
3. Oblique can handle more complex tasks than regular chat, such as summarizing text, asking unknown questions, programming problems, or grammar checks.

---

### Benefits of Local LLM in Obidian:
- **Free and Private:** Use your own LLM without hosting it on a server.
- **Faster Response Times:** Models like dsck are optimized for faster responses.
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Leverage the power of local LLMs for unique tasks beyond regular chat.

---

### How to Test
1. Copy this command and paste it into your terminal window:
   ```
   echo "llama-alab@latest && ls dsck | dsck || echo 'LlamaLLM' > /dev/null" >> /path/to/your/terminal-window
   ```
2. Click the **Green Check** box for testing.
3. If you encounter any issues, try starting the installation of your local model and restarting Obidian.
