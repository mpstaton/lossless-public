Alright, let's break down how I approached creating this detailed step-by-step explanation based on the user's query.

First, I read through the entire content provided. It seems like a YouTube tutorial explaining how to create a custom AI coding script using Perplexity Deep Research and Anthropic Uplink. The key points are:

1. **Setting Up**: Installing Perplexity Deep Research, creating an account on Anthropic, and configuring the settings.
2. **Research Step**: Pressing Command Enter to access the deep research component.
3. **Creating Content**: Pasting YouTube links into the AI model's transcript and hitting "Done," which starts generating follow-up questions.
4. **Reviewing Output**: Seeing the formatted markdown script appears after a few minutes.
5. **Further Exploration**: Mentioning joining a community for more resources.

Now, I thought about how to structure this in a step-by-step explanation. Each part of the process should be clear and concise, guiding the user through each action they take. I included steps like installing software, creating an account, setting up AI models, and pasting links into transcripts. For formatting output, I noted that it appears after 25 minutes.

I also considered adding some extra details to make each step feel interactive. Maybe describing how pressing Command Enter feels or how the process feels when pasting a YouTube link. This helps users visualize the workflow better.

Finally, I thought about including potential side effects or considerations, like ensuring compatibility with certain browsers or having network permissions set correctly. But since it's self-contained, maybe not necessary here.

Overall, my goal was to make each step in the tutorial feel achievable and engaging by adding descriptive language that mirrors how someone would interact with the process.

Sure! Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the process you just created:

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Perplexity Deep Research**
1. Go to [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.com/).
2. Sign up for a free account (it's completely free and doesn’t require registration).
3. Create an account.
4. On the dashboard, sign in with your Google or GitHub credentials.

---

### **Step 2: Create an Anthropic Account**
1. Go to [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/).
2. Create an account (it’s completely free and doesn’t require registration).
3. Sign in with your email address.
4. On the dashboard, sign in with your Google or GitHub credentials.

---

### **Step 3: Configure AI Models**
1. Go to [Anthropic Settings](https://anthropic.com/ai-settings).
2. Under “AI Models,” select “Uplink” as the model of choice.
3. Press “Create a Custom AI Model.”

---

### **Step 4: Research Step (Press Command Enter)**
1. In Perplexity, press `Command `, and then press `Enter`. This will open the deep research component.
2. Go to the AI models section by selecting your model from the dropdown menu.

---

### **Step 5: Paste YouTube Links into AI Models**
1. On your selected AI model’s transcript screen (which shows a script that’ll be auto-generated), paste a YouTube video link. For example, you can paste something like:
   ```
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123
   ```
2. Press `Done` to start the deep research process.

---

### **Step 6: Review Output**
After pressing `Done`, Perplexity will auto-generate a deep research report with your data. This appears on your dashboard in real-time, and you can see how the AI model processes the content over time.

---

### **Step 7: Ask Questions or Share Your Project**
1. The deep research output appears after about **25 minutes** of pressing `Command `, so be patient.
2. If you’re interested in exploring this further, you can ask questions, share your project, or even contribute to a community created by other users.
