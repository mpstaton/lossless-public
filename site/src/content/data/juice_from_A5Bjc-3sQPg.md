Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to build this keep going app. The user gave me a detailed breakdown, but I want to make sure I get it right. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, they mention building a landing page using V0 and then prompting wind surf for more code. That makes sense because V0 is good for the frontend. But I wonder if there are any specific components or libraries in V0 that I should look into for better performance. Maybe Tailwind CSS or something else? Also, how do they integrate Stripe for payments with wind surfs? Probably through a separate payment integrator.

Next, on the front end, landing page is handled by wind surfs Cascade and Stripe. That seems straightforward. But what about routing? How does wind surfs ensure that all necessary pages are loaded before the user hits a notification? Maybe they use background jobs to schedule notifications or use dynamic routing with JavaScript.

The backend code using Supercube is mentioned, which I know from their previous project. So, if everything on the frontend works well, how do they handle authentication and authorization in Stripe? They probably integrate with Stripe's API for that. Oh, and what about setting up email configurations and ensuring SSL during development? That might take some time but seems manageable.

Then, moving to the next phase: the notifications system. They pull data from Stripe and wind surfs. So, if someone isn't logged in, this might cause issues. How do they handle authentication for notifications? Maybe using SSO with a separate account? Or is there a way to redirect users when they aren't authorized?

The payments section uses stripe-resign, which I think is a tool that integrates Stripe's payment functionality. So, if someone logs in via Stripe, it should automatically trigger the payment. That sounds good but what about edge cases like multiple transactions from one account? The payment integrator probably handles that.

On the back end, using Supercube for front-end code and Stripe for backend is efficient. But I'm not sure how they set up the background jobs for notifications. Each notification might need its own job to ensure they run on time and correctly. Also, what about scalability? If there are a lot of notifications, can they all be handled at once without hitting performance issues?

In terms of challenges, I think front-end code was okay because V0 is good, but maybe not as fast as before. They had to spend hours tweaking it. Backend was tough because you have to manage SSO and security tightly. Also, integrating Stripe with wind surfs might require some setup that wasn't obvious at first.

Lessons learned: Using AI for front-end seems better than writing code manually. But they still needed some manual tweaking. For the backend, using full-stack frameworks helped a bit, but it's hard to get the models right without knowing their specific needs. Also, getting deployment ready is tricky because you can't use Repet or bolt directly.

I'm curious about how they handle notifications on different devices and browsers. Are there any localization issues? They probably tried testing in multiple environments but might have missed some edge cases that affected performance.

Overall, I think the approach was solid, using AI to speed up development and front-end work, while manually handling the backend and integration parts. But it's clear they had to invest a lot of time getting everything set up correctly.

To build your keep going app effectively, consider the following organized approach:

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - **Landing Page:** Utilize V0 for its robust front-end capabilities. Explore components like Tailwind CSS for styling and dynamic JavaScript for routing. Integrate Stripe via a separate payment integrator to handle Stripe payments.
   - **Background Jobs:** Implement background jobs to schedule notifications, ensuring they run smoothly on different devices and browsers. Use timeouts and retry mechanisms as needed.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - **Supercube:** Use Supercube for efficient front-end code generation and deployment. Set up a local development environment with debug logs and tools like venv and poetry to manage dependencies.
   - **Stripe Integration:** Integrate Stripe's API into your backend to handle payments and notifications. Ensure proper authentication and authorization for users who may not be logged in.

3. **Challenges and Solutions:**
   - **Frontend Performance:** Address issues by manually tweaking front-end code, especially when using V0. Review documentation and best practices to optimize performance.
   - **Backend Security:** Use full-stack frameworks like Next.js with Express.js to leverage security features. Test models for accuracy in notifications and handle edge cases through custom validation and error handling.

4. **Lessons Learned:**
   - **Frontend Efficiency:** AI tools are powerful for front-end work, reducing manual coding but requiring some manual intervention.
   - **Backend Challenges:** Integration with Stripe and other platforms may require careful setup and testing to ensure smooth operations.
   - **Deployment Ready:** While deployment using Repet or bolt isn't straightforward, set up background jobs and use timeouts to manage notifications effectively.

5. **Considerations:**
   - **Edge Cases:** Test for various scenarios, including multiple transactions from the same account and devices, to ensure robustness.
   - **Localization:** Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to avoid localization issues that could affect performance.

By following this structured approach, you can efficiently develop your keep going app while leveraging AI tools where possible.
