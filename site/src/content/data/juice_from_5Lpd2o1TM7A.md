Alright, let me try to figure out what's happening with the knowledge base. The user mentioned some issues like corrupted files or slow uploads, but I need to look deeper into it.

First, when the user tried using embeddings, they set up an emitting model. It worked for one document but then crashed again because of a corrupted file. Maybe there was a temporary glitch in my internet connection or something went wrong with their server. They probably didn't realize that until after hours.

Then there's the marketing collateral issue. The knowledge base had some problems extracting text without images, but they fixed it by changing the data type to ASER. That makes sense because ASER can handle text and structured data better than EXR for specific tasks like embeddings. Without a good data source, embedding models might not work well.

I should mention these two points separately since they're related. Also, I think the user is on an older device where internet connectivity was more critical when using external links. They probably need to ensure their internet connection is stable while working with external URLs.

It's also worth noting that ASER data handling can be tricky if not done correctly. Maybe the user needs to take extra precautions when uploading files, especially if they have images involved. They should double-check the file types and any specific requirements before uploading.

Overall, the knowledge base is functioning well except for these two edge cases with corrupted files and extraction issues. Encouraging the user to keep their internet connection stable while using external links might help them avoid future problems.

It sounds like you're encountering some issues when using the knowledge base. Let me break down what's happening:

1. **Corrupted File Issues**:
   - When trying to load certain documents or URLs, your internet connection might be unstable, leading to temporary glitches and corrupted files.
   - The user mentioned that after a few hours of waiting, their file was corrupted. This could mean you're using external links (e.g., URLs from other websites) while your internet is slow or unstable.

2. **Marketing Collateral Issue**:
   - You correctly identified the need to switch the data type to ASER when extracting text without images. ASER can handle text and structured data better than EXR, which primarily deals with images.
   - Once you set the correct data type, your knowledge base should work more smoothly.

3. **General Tips**:
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable while using external links or URLs.
   - If you're working with images, make sure ASER is properly configured to handle them without issues.
