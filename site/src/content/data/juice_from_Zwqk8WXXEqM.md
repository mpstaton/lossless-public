Alright, the user wants to decide between Aity Designer and Procreate. Let me go through their thought process step by step.

First, they mentioned that both are vector-based apps but have different strengths. The user listed several points each has, so I should break down each of those areas.

For vectors, Aity is better for logo design because everything scales nicely without loss. Procreate, on the other hand, uses raster brushes which might be smoother but not as versatile for symbolic designs or logos where consistency and scaling are crucial.

Next, both apps support multiple artboards, but Aity's desktop version is a big plus since it's two in one. Procreate lacks that feature, so if they need to work on several projects at once, Aity would be better.

Affinity Design is a good alternative for those who want more tools and features beyond just vector design. I should include that as a point because users often look for comprehensive editing options.

The support on both apps for iPad is great. Procreate had some issues with the interface, but now they're fixed. Aity's support is even better, so it's worth considering if they plan to use both.

The pixel Persona mode sounds powerful for exporting and managing multiple personas. It's versatile and can export a lot of content efficiently, which might be appealing for those needing to switch between design styles quickly.

Price-wise, Procreate is cheaper but offers more features compared to Aity. The user didn't mention specific budget constraints, so mentioning the price point is helpful in deciding who to target.

Looking ahead, Procreate has animation support, which could be a big selling point depending on what they need. Affinity Design might have even better tools if they explore further.

The modern interface of both apps is a plus for simplicity and learning curve. It's crucial that the user understands how easy it is to start with either app.

In summary, while Aity offers more extensive features and support, Procreate has an edge in vector design, multiple projects support, and animation capabilities. The choice depends on their primary needs and budget.
