Alright, so I just saw this whole video about a chatbot called Flow-Wise. It's supposed to be super helpful for answering questions and providing information quickly. But when I tried it, sometimes it couldn't find the answer or even gave me some strange results. Hmm, what could be going on here?

First off, I need to understand how Flow-Wise works. From what I remember, it uses something called a Vector Store and embeddings. Embeddings are like turning text into numbers so that similar words have similar numbers. That makes sense because when you search for information, you're essentially searching through these numerical representations.

So maybe the problem is with how the knowledge base was set up. The user added an O Barrel document, but I'm not sure if it's related to the stake question. Let me think—O Barrel isn't a restaurant in California or anything like that. It's probably just some random place. Oh wait! Maybe there was a bug in Pine Cone or another part of the system?

I should check how Flow-Wise handles knowledge bases. When you attach a knowledge base, does it require specific configurations? Maybe I didn't set up the Vector Store properly, or perhaps the embeddings aren't working as expected for certain types of data like documents. I'll need to look into Pine Cone documentation to see if there's a step-by-step guide on how to add a knowledge store and configure embeddings.

Also, the user mentioned saving the chatbot externally, which is good because sometimes local files might get corrupted or misconfigured. But just in case, using an external URL seems safer. I should make sure that when they call Flow-Wise from another place, it's going through the correct parameters to avoid any issues.

Another thing could be how the knowledge base was attached. If there were any errors during attachment, maybe the code snippet provided wasn't correctly formatted, or perhaps the description didn't include enough information for Flow-Wise to find the right answer. I'll need to double-check that they included all necessary details when using the chatbot's API.

Lastly, the user tried calling it from a website and an external application but got strange results. Maybe there are limitations on certain types of questions or specific keywords that aren't supported in Flow-Wise yet. They should check the supported queries section to see what kinds of questions they can ask correctly.

Overall, I think the main issues could be with the knowledge base setup—maybe not configured properly for text data or embeddings—and ensuring that both local and external calls are set up correctly. By addressing these potential problems step by step, the user should get more reliable answers from Flow-Wise.

The issue you're experiencing with Flow-Wise might stem from a combination of factors related to how the knowledge base is configured and used. Here's a breakdown of potential solutions:

1. **Knowledge Base Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your O Barrel document is correctly associated with an appropriate knowledge store. Check Pine Cone documentation for proper configuration.
   - Verify that the Vector Store is properly set up, especially if it requires specific configurations (e.g., using embeddings for text data).
   - Confirm that all documents in your knowledge base are properly uploaded and upserted to avoid duplicates.

2. **External Calls**:
   - When calling Flow-Wise from an external application or URL, ensure you follow the correct parameters specified in the chatbot's API documentation.
   - Test if there are any restrictions on certain types of queries or keywords supported by Flow-Wise.

3. **Local vs. External Issues**:
   - If using a local knowledge base, make sure it is up to date and properly uploaded before attempting to access external calls.
   - Ensure that the chatbot's URL and parameters are correctly formatted when making external calls.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Review error messages from Pine Cone for any specific issues related to your knowledge base setup or use of the chatbot.
   - Check if there are known limitations in supporting certain types of questions or keywords, and adjust accordingly.

By addressing these potential areas, you should be able to enhance the reliability of Flow-Wise's responses, including providing accurate stake information at O Barrel.
