# Standardized Frontmatter Across Prompts Directory

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Complete Frontmatter to Files
Added complete frontmatter template to 7 files that were missing it:
- Create-a-Canvas-UI-of-our-Content-and-Data-Models.md
- Create-or-Update-Open-Graph-Data.md
- Fix-one-YAML-Issue-at-a-Time.md
- Manageable User Options.md
- Return-only-files-with-valid-Frontmatter..md
- Write-a-Changelog-Entry.md
- Writing-Correction-Functions.md

### 2. Converted Tag Arrays to YAML Syntax
Converted tag arrays to proper YAML bullet list syntax in 4 files:
- Create-a-Basic-Changelog.md
- Create-a-Price-Card.md
- Maintain-a-Session-Log.md
- Write-a-Technical-Specification.md

### 3. Field Name Updates
Updated field name from 'generated_with' to 'augmented_with' in:
- Write-a-Raw-Text-Git-Commit.md

## Implementation Details

### Frontmatter Template
All files now include:
- Title
- Lede (description)
- Date fields (initial draft, current draft, final draft, first published, last updated)
- Semantic versioning
- Authors
- Status
- Augmentation information
- Category
- Tags in YAML bullet list format

### Tag Syntax Standardization
Following the regex pattern from Cases-and-Corrections-for-YAML-Content-Wide.md:
```javascript
/(?:tags:\s*(?:\[.*?\]|.*?,.*?|['"].*?['"])|(?:^|\n)\s*-\s*\w+[^\S\n]+\w+)/
```

All tags are now formatted as:
```yaml
tags:
- Tag-One
- Tag-Two
```

### Value Preservation
- All existing values were preserved except for tag syntax formatting
- Only missing fields were added from template
- No content modifications were made outside of frontmatter

## Documentation
- Session log: site/src/content/lost-in-public/sessions/2025-03-18_01.md
- Git commit message created with comprehensive file list
- Memory created to record standardization work
