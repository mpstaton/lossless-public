# YAML Prescreening and Triaging System Implementation

## Core Objectives

### 1. Early Detection and Prevention
- Implement a first-line validation system to catch YAML formatting issues
- Proactively identify issues before they propagate to downstream build processes
- Evaluate content against common formatting problems using regex-based detection
- Create clear separation between critical and non-critical issues
- Provide non-blocking operation for files with minor inconsistencies

### 2. Automated Correction
- Develop specialized correction functions for common formatting issues
- Implement function-specific correction logic with consistent error handling
- Support pattern-specific correction strategies for targeted fixes
- Track and report all correction attempts, both successful and unsuccessful
- Preserve content meaning and structure while fixing formatting issues

### 3. Content Triaging
- Sort content files into three distinct categories based on YAML health
- Identify totally clean files that can proceed without modification
- Flag files with minor inconsistencies that need partial operation exclusion
- Screen out files with critical issues that cannot be safely processed
- Map affected operations to specific files for targeted processing

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
- Generate detailed reports on file processing and categorization
- Create separate reports for screened-in and screened-out files
- Provide insights into operation impact through non-blocking observations
- Include statistics on processing results and correction attempts
- Enable downstream processes to consume report data for decision-making

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Pattern-Based Detection System
```javascript
const CORRUPTION_PATTERNS = [
  // Missing closing delimiter
  { 
    pattern: /^---\n(?![\s\S]*?\n---\n)/m,
    messageToLog: 'Has opening delimiter but missing closing YAML frontmatter delimiter',
    preventsOperations: ['fetchOpenGraphData.cjs', 'assureYAMLPropertiesCorrect.cjs'],
    correctionFunction: 'attemptToFixMissingDelimiter',
    isCritical: true
  },
  
  // Block scalar formatting issues
  { 
    pattern: /^([^:\n]+):[ \t]*(>-|>|[|][-]?)[ \t]*(\S.*)$/gm, 
    messageToLog: 'Block scalar indicator without newline',
    preventsOperations: ['assureYAMLPropertiesCorrect.cjs'],
    correctionFunction: 'attemptToFixBlockScalar',
    isCritical: true
  },
  
  // Duplicate keys in frontmatter
  { 
    pattern: /^([\w-]+):[^\n]*\n(?:[\s\S]*?)^\1:/m, 
    messageToLog: 'Duplicate keys in frontmatter',
    preventsOperations: ['assureYAMLPropertiesCorrect.cjs'],
    correctionFunction: 'attemptToFixDuplicateKeys',
    isCritical: true
  },
  
  // Additional patterns for various formatting issues...
]
```

### 2. Correction Functions Architecture
```javascript
const correctionFunctions = {
  attemptToFixMissingDelimiter: (filePath, content) => {
    try {
      // Logic to detect content start and add delimiter
      return {
        success: true,
        message: 'Added closing YAML delimiter before content start',
        updatedContent: modifiedContent
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        message: `Error while attempting to fix: ${error.message}`
      };
    }
  },
  
  // Additional correction functions for each issue type...
}
```

### 3. File Processing Workflow
1. **Discovery Phase**:
   - Recursively scan content directories for markdown files
   - Build a comprehensive file list for processing
   - Track total file count for statistics

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - For each file, read content and check for critical issues
   - Apply pattern detection to identify specific formatting problems
   - Attempt corrections when possible based on pattern metadata
   - Track correction attempts and outcomes

3. **Categorization Phase**:
   - Sort files into three distinct categories based on analysis
   - Map specific operations that are impacted for each file
   - Track which correction attempts succeeded and which failed
   - Build data structures for reporting

4. **Reporting Phase**:
   - Generate statistics on overall processing results
   - Create detailed reports for each file category
   - Format reports in markdown with frontmatter
   - Write reports to designated output locations without validation

### 4. Report Writing Implementation
```javascript
function writeResultsToFile() {
  // Format timestamp and prepare report content
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  
  // Force-create output directories
  const outputDir = path.dirname(TARGET_SCREENED_IN_FILES_FILE_PATH);
  try {
    fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
  } catch (e) {
    // Ignore directory errors and continue
  }
  
  // Format and write screened-in files report
  const screenedInContent = `---
updated_on: "${timestamp}"
included_file_count: ${totallyCleanFiles.length + filesWithMinorInconsistencies.length}
totally_clean_files: ${totallyCleanFiles.length}
files_with_minor_inconsistencies: ${filesWithMinorInconsistencies.length}
total_file_count: ${totalFileCount}
successful_corrections: ${successfulCorrections}
---

# Markdown Files Screened-In for Processing
// Report content...
`;

  // Format and write non-blocking observations report
  const nonBlockingContent = `---
updated_on: "${timestamp}"
---

# Non-Blocking Observations
// Report content...
`;

  // Format and write screened-out files report
  const screenedOutContent = `---
updated_on: "${timestamp}"
included_file_count: ${filesWithCriticalIssues.length}
total_file_count: ${totalFileCount}
---

# Markdown Files Screened-Out from Processing
// Report content...
`;

  // Force-write all files without error checking
  try { fs.writeFileSync(TARGET_SCREENED_IN_FILES_FILE_PATH, screenedInContent, {flag: 'w'}); } catch (e) {}
  try { fs.writeFileSync(TARGET_NON_BLOCKING_OBSERVATIONS_FILE_PATH, nonBlockingContent, {flag: 'w'}); } catch (e) {}
  try { fs.writeFileSync(TARGET_SCREENED_OUT_FILES_FILE_PATH, screenedOutContent, {flag: 'w'}); } catch (e) {}
}
```

- Use the exported functions for integration
- Extend patterns with caution, maintaining metadata
- Preserve the three-category system for downstream processes
- Ensure report generation is never blocked by errors

### For Content Authors
- Review reports to understand content health
- Focus on files with critical issues first
- Address repeated patterns across multiple files
- Understand which operations might be affected by issues
- Use the correction output as guidance for manual fixes

## AI Assistant Constraints

To ensure reliable operation of this critical system component, AI Code Assistants working with this code must:

### 1. Report Generation
- Never add validation that prevents report files from being overwritten
- Always ensure reports are generated regardless of errors
- Use direct file writing operations with the 'w' flag
- Never create dependencies between report generation and processing success

### 2. Error Handling
- Isolate errors to individual files rather than stopping the entire process
- Log errors but continue processing remaining files
- Avoid adding additional validation logic without explicit permission
- Maintain the clear separation between critical and non-critical issues

### 3. Integration
- Preserve all exported functions and their signatures
- Maintain backward compatibility with code that uses this module
- Respect the environment variable configuration options
- Present clear explanations for any proposed changes

This implementation significantly improves our content management pipeline by catching and correcting YAML issues early, preventing downstream build failures, and providing clear visibility into content health across the repository.
