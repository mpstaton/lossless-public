> To print to a file with your terminal's theme colors, you can use the `script` command, redirecting the output to a file and then optionally use `scriptreplay` to replay the session with colors preserved. 
> 
> Here's a breakdown of the process:
> 
> 1. Using the `script` command:
> 
> - **Start the recording:** `script -q /dev/null`
>     - `-q` option suppresses the start/end messages.
>     - `/dev/null` discards the output of the script command itself.
> - **Run your commands:** Execute the commands you want to capture, including those that produce colored output.
> - **Stop the recording:** Press `Ctrl+D` to exit the script command. 
> 
> 1. Redirecting output to a file:
> 
> - **Start the recording:**
>     
>     `script -q -c "your_command" /dev/null`
>     
>     - `-c` option allows you to specify a command to run.
>     - `/dev/null` discards the output of the script command itself.
>     
> - **Redirect output:**
>     
>     `your_command > output.txt`
>     
>     - `your_command` is the command you want to capture, including those that produce colored output.
>     - `>` redirects the output to the file `output.txt`. 
>     
> 
> 3. (Optional) Replay with colors:
> 
> - **Replay the session:** `scriptreplay output.txt`
>     - This command will replay the session, preserving the colors. 
> 
> Example:
> 
> Let's say you want to capture the output of `ls -l` with colors: 
> 
> 1. **Start the recording:** `script -q /dev/null`
> 2. **Run the command:** `ls -l`
> 3. **Stop the recording:** `Ctrl+D`
> 4. **Redirect output to a file:** `ls -l > output.txt`
> 5. **(Optional) Replay with colors:** `scriptreplay output.txt`
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> - The `script` command captures the terminal session, including the ANSI escape codes that control colors.
> - By redirecting the output to a file, you can save the colored output.
> - `scriptreplay` can then be used to replay the session, preserving the colors.

[Terminal output with all the colors](https://brettterpstra.com/2022/06/07/terminal-output-with-all-the-colors/)

[[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Warp|Warp]] was able to walk me through the fact that typical text editors don't render ASCII colors, so there for we needed to use [[Homebrew]] to install a package that handles ASCII color and formats to HTML.  

```bash
brew install aha
```
