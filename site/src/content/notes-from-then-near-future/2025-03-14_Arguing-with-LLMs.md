![CHAT] Arguing with LLM Dialog:
Claude 3.5 sonnet was unable to maintain enough context to complete this refactor of build scripts to implement separation of concerns.  I fired them, and now I am hiring you, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking.  I hope you can keep more context.

We are working from an orchestrator script that will eventually be run at build, 'pnpm build'..  Right now, I am running it from node as we work through this refactor. The orchestrator script is @masterBuildScriptOrchestrator.cjs .  

Please review the logic. I have given you the context directories that includes all of the files within the /build-script directory attached in context, as well as all of the changelog files we generated today in /changelong--code

I have also attached a draft specification that I have started but I can't write as fast as you.  

I would like you to
1. Read the @Build-Script-Spec.md draft as it is.
2. Read through @2025-03-13_01.md @2025-03-13_02.md @2025-03-13_03.md @2025-03-13_04.md and @2025-03-14_01.md to see summary of the progress today, also to understand what we were working towards and where we are. 
3. Read through the @masterBuildScriptOrchestrator.cjs while keeping in mind the context of the other files in the build-scripts directory. Of relevance now and in sequential order are @getUserOptionsForBuild.cjs , @getReportingFormatForBuild.cjs , @evaluateTargetContent.cjs , @assureYAMLPropertiesCorrect.cjs , @fetchOpenGraphData.cjs 

While 3.5 sonnet and I were working through trying to perfect the @getReportingFormatForBuild.cjs reporting functionality, 3.5 sonnet overwrote working code, scrambled the YAML syntax in all of my target content files, and as of right now when I run the script -- nothing happens at all.

Please allow me to type 'node scripts/masterBuildScriptOrchestrator.cjs' and have it run through the script and create the report according to the @getReportingFormatForBuild.cjs formatting specifications. 

We will go on from there.
