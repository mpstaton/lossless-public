description: TOTEM explores time series unification through discrete tokens (not patches!!). Its simple VQVAE backbone learns a self-supervised, discrete, codebook in either a generalist (multiple domains) or specialist (1 domain) manner. TOTEM's codebook can then be tested on in domain or zero shot data with many ðŸ”¥ time series tasks.
