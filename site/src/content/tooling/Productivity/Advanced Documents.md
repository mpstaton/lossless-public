[[Advanced Documents]], alternately called [[Advanced Documents|Collaborative Documents]], or [[Advanced Documents|Documents Reimagined]] is a very dynamic, rapidly evolving set of tools that leap out from traditional personal productivity applications, notably Microsoft Word.  

Most offer [[Realtime Collaboration]], in which each individual can see where and what others are working on, jump in, help with content creation and edits.  Most have a robust [[REST API]], and have many [[One-Click Integrations]], which enable all kinds of [[Workflow Automations]].  

The current market leader is [[Notion]], which boasts a massive user-base.  The most feature-rich competitor to [[Notion]] is [[Coda]], however [[Coda]] was acquired by [[Grammerly]].  [[Microsoft]], which of course has the most massive business customer-base, has introduced [[Microsoft Loop|Loop]]. 


An early market entrant was [[Quip]], quickly acquired by [[Salesforce]] and likely has strong integrations with the [[Salesforce]] platform and tooling, thus potentially being good for [[Sales Support]].
