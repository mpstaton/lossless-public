## Git Hooks

>Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Git’s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle. Atlassian[ on Git Hooks](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks#:~:text=Git%20hooks%20are%20scripts%20that,in%20the%20development%20life%20cycle.).

### Branch Naming Strategies

Branch names can be anything you’d like. However, your organization or project may have standards outlined for branch naming. For example, naming the branch based on the person responsible for working on the branch and a description or work item:

- username/description
- username/workitem

You can name a branch to indicate the branch’s function, like a feature, bug fix, or hotfix:

- bugfix/description
- feature/feature-name
- hotfix/description

Another branching strategy is having branches dedicated to the different development cycles, like feature or hotfix. As work items come up, you create a branch for that item from its respective branch. Yes, you can create branches from branches! Check out Option 4 below for an example. [^1]
