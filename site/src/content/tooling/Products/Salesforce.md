## Modular Upsells

[[Salesforce]] is both a "modular" and a "seat-based" solution, and it is priced the same. So there is always something pretty cool or even slightly crucial they Salesforce will want to upsell customers. The more functionality you add, and the more people have seats to Salesforce, the more Laerdal gets billed.  Trying to keep Salesforce costs down is a whole endeavor. This is how they create [[Lock In]].   ^bec3e9

## Purpose Creep

>"When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

[[Salesforce]] can grow tentacles that will wrap around and through any organization, driving up costs and creating [[Organizational Friction]] and [[Drag]]. It wants to be an extensible platform. So, it pretends to be [[Best-in-class]] for all kinds of business operations for which it is not really the easiest, cheapest, or best solution.  It's very common for businesses to get lost in a quagmire of consultants reconfiguring Salesforce to do other things in a quixotic quest to "align on one platform."  ^24aaab
