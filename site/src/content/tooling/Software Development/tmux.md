[[Perplexity AI]] explains [[tmux]]
**tmux** (short for *terminal multiplexer*) is a command-line tool that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. Each session can contain multiple windows, which can be further split into panes, each running its own process. Here’s why people use it:

### Key Features and Benefits:
- **Session Management:** Users can create persistent sessions that remain active even if the terminal is closed or the connection is lost. Sessions can be detached and reattached later, preserving the state of running processes[1][2][7].
- **Multitasking:** Tmux enables splitting the terminal into multiple panes or windows, allowing users to run and monitor multiple tasks simultaneously without opening new terminal windows[3][4].
- **Remote Work:** It is especially useful for managing remote servers via SSH, as it prevents interruptions from dropped connections and allows seamless reconnection[5][7].
- **Customization:** Highly configurable with options for key bindings, layouts, and status bars to suit individual workflows[2][9].
- **Collaboration:** Multiple users can share a tmux session for real-time collaboration on remote servers[2].
- **Scripting and Automation:** Tmux supports scripting, making it ideal for automating repetitive tasks or creating custom workflows[2][9].

Tmux is widely used by developers, system administrators, and anyone working extensively in the terminal for its efficiency, persistence, and flexibility.
