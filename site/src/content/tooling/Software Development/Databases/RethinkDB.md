zinger: The open-source database for the realtime web
description: >-
  RethinkDB pushes JSON to your apps in realtime. When your app polls for data,
  it becomes slow, unscalable, and cumbersome to maintain. RethinkDB is the
  open-source, scalable database that makes building realtime apps dramatically
