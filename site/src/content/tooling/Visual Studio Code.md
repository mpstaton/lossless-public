# VS Code Extensions
[[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] has a very robust [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]] library.

[[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] also employs the [[Come one, come all]] approach, allowing anyone to try to build and publish an [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]]. Notice the "Build your own" and "Publish extensions" options in the upper right corner.

Because [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] has such a streamlined and open [[Extension Libraries|Extension Library]], most [[Influencer]] developers do their demonstrations on [[YouTube]] using [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]].
