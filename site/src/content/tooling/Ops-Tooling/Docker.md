#### Docker Hub is an [[Input Markets|Input Marketplace]]
How [[Docker]] implements [[Platform Mechanisms]]. Container [[Containers#Container Images|Images]] are a representation of the necessary technologies and code libraries necessary to run a program, a piece of software, or an application. To become more Platform-like, [[Docker]] created an [[Input Markets|Input Market]], where people can post Images that help others get started  with their software.
