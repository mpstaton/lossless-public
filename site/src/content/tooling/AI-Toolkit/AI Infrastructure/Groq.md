> [!NOTE] [[Perplexity AI]] explains [[AI-Toolkit/AI Infrastructure/Groq|Groq]]
> Groq is an AI hardware and software company that specializes in developing high-performance AI accelerators and inference solutions. Their key product is the Language Processing Unit (LPU), an AI chip designed specifically for accelerating large language models (LLMs) and other AI workloads[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groq)[7](https://www.techpowerup.com/319286/groq-lpu-ai-inference-chip-is-rivaling-major-players-like-nvidia-amd-and-intel).
> 
> ## Groq's Technology
> 
> ## Hardware
> 
> - [[LPU]] (Language Processing Unit): A single-core AI accelerator chip based on the Tensor-Streaming Processor (TSP) architecture[7](https://www.techpowerup.com/319286/groq-lpu-ai-inference-chip-is-rivaling-major-players-like-nvidia-amd-and-intel)
>     
> - Performance: 750 TOPS at INT8 and 188 TeraFLOPS at FP16[7](https://www.techpowerup.com/319286/groq-lpu-ai-inference-chip-is-rivaling-major-players-like-nvidia-amd-and-intel)
>     
> - Features: 320x320 fused dot product matrix multiplication, 5,120 Vector ALUs, 80 TB/s bandwidth, and 230 MB of local SRAM[7](https://www.techpowerup.com/319286/groq-lpu-ai-inference-chip-is-rivaling-major-players-like-nvidia-amd-and-intel)
>     
> 
> ## Software
> 
> - GroqCloud: A cloud platform that allows developers to access Groq's hardware for AI inference[5](https://groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/)
>     
> 
> ## Models and Performance
> 
> Groq doesn't create its own AI models but rather optimizes existing open-source models to run on their hardware. Some of the models they've optimized include:
> 
> - Llama 2 (various sizes)
>     
> - Mixtral 8x7B
>     
> - DeepSeek models
>     
> - Qwen models[10](https://artificialanalysis.ai/providers/groq)
>     
> 
> ## Performance Gains
> 
> Groq has demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional GPU-based solutions:
> 
> - Throughput: Up to 241 tokens per second on Llama 2 Chat (70B), more than double the speed of other providers[5](https://groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/)
>     
> - Latency: As low as 0.23 seconds for some models[10](https://artificialanalysis.ai/providers/groq)
>     
> - Context Window: Up to 131k tokens for certain models[10](https://artificialanalysis.ai/providers/groq)
>     
> 
> In benchmarks, Groq's LPU has shown:
> 
> - 4x faster speeds
>     
> - 5x lower costs
>     
> - 3x greater energy efficiency compared to traditional GPUs[12](https://resource-erectors.com/groq-vs-grok-and-grokking-the-nvidia-gpu-vs-lpu-contest/)
>     
> 
> ## Groq vs. Grok
> 
> It's important to note that Groq and Grok are fundamentally different:
> 
> 1. Groq is an AI hardware and inference solution, while Grok is an AI chatbot developed by xAI (Elon Musk's company)[11](https://gizmodo.com/meet-groq-ai-chip-leaves-elon-musk-s-grok-in-the-dust-1851271871).
>     
> 2. Groq can be used to accelerate various AI models, including potentially Grok itself, while Grok is a specific AI model for natural language interactions[11](https://gizmodo.com/meet-groq-ai-chip-leaves-elon-musk-s-grok-in-the-dust-1851271871).
>     
> 
> Reasons to use Groq:
> 
> 1. Speed: Groq's technology can significantly accelerate AI inference, potentially making any AI model, including Grok, run faster[11](https://gizmodo.com/meet-groq-ai-chip-leaves-elon-musk-s-grok-in-the-dust-1851271871).
>     
> 2. Efficiency: Lower energy consumption and potentially lower costs for running AI workloads[12](https://resource-erectors.com/groq-vs-grok-and-grokking-the-nvidia-gpu-vs-lpu-contest/).
>     
> 3. Versatility: Groq can be used with various open-source models, allowing users to choose or switch between different AI solutions[10](https://artificialanalysis.ai/providers/groq).
>     
> 
> In summary, Groq provides the underlying technology to make AI models run faster and more efficiently, while Grok is a specific AI model. Organizations looking to improve the performance of their AI applications, regardless of the specific model they use, might consider Groq's solutions.
